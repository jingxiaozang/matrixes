This is also the condition present in "- Luisiella feruglioi. In contrast, the frontal bones of pachycormiforms (De Pinna 1996),(Mainwaring  1978), osteoglossomorphs (Li & Wilson 1996),(Hilton 2003) as well as those of some ostariophysan groups (e.g. Gonorynchiformes, Siluriformes, Characiformes; (Arratia 1999),(Weitzman 1962)) have anterior and posterior margins of similar widths (e.g. Hiodon, Brycon) or even anterior margins slightly wider than posterior margins (e.g. Heterotis). ^nThe definition of this character was modified from previous authors to represent the variability observed in our taxonomic sample as accurately as possible. Li and Wilson (Li & Wilson 1996) scored three character states of which only the state (0), i.e. the occurrence of an anterior portion of the frontal narrower or slightly broader than the posterior end of the bone, is represented in our sample. Arratia considered the variation in the shape of the frontal bones in several analyses (Arratia 2013),(Arratia 1999),(Arratia 2000a, Mitt Mus Natkd Berl Geowiss Reihe.),(Arratia 2000b, Pal"¤ontol Z.),(Arratia 2008a, Geological Society). However, the different characters that were used to represent this variation either do not reflect the different morphologies in our data set or imply a mixture of non-homologous features (e.g. width and length, frontal width compared with the fusion of the frontals to other cranial bones). In her most recent cladistic analysis, a character representing the variation in the shape of the skull roof as a whole is proposed (Arratia 2013). According to our observations, however, the shape of the skull roof is mainly determined by the shape of the frontal bones and, thus, Arratia"-™s (Arratia 2013) character would be equivalent to our character 2. Arratia"-™s definition might be preferable only when the frontals are fused in the studied taxa, but this is not the case in the present analysis. Finally, Hilton (Hilton 2003) proposed this character in his phylogeny of Osteoglossomorpha, although he included a new state distinguishing the cases in which the anterior margin of the frontal is about equal in width to its posterior margin from those where the anterior margin is wider. This distinction is not obvious in our taxonomic sample and therefore we have not used this coding.  ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='Modified from Li & Wilson (1996: ch. 12), Li & Wilson (1999: ch. 2), Hilton (2003: ch. 7)^n^nAccording to our observations, in most teleosts the nasal bones are straight, tubular bones, almost reduced to ossifications around the supraorbital sensory canals, such as those observed in "- Luisiella feruglioi. However, these bones are not tubular but flat, triangular plates in the basal teleost "- Siemensichthys macrocephalus, whereas they are broad, approximately rectangular plate-like ossifications in the basal teleosts "- Pholidophorus gervasutti and "- Dorsetichthys bechei (Arratia 2013),(Arratia 2000b, Pal"¤ontol Z.),(Grande & Bemis 1998) as well as in some teleocephalan taxa (e.g. Heterotis, "- Humbertia, Denticeps, Thymallus). Notably, the nasals are tubular and strongly curved in the living osteoglossomorph Hiodon (Li & Wilson 1996),(Hilton 2002). Among the outgroup taxa, the nasals are broad and rectangular in Amia (Grande & Bemis 1998) and variably broad, but approximately rectangular and not tubular in lepisosteiforms, pachycormids, and aspidorhynchiforms (Mainwaring  1978),(Brito 1997),(Grande 2010). This character is not applicable to pycnodontiforms because they lack nasal bones (e.g. "- Mesturus; (Kriwet 2001)).^nLi and Wilson (Li & Wilson 1996),(Li & Wilson 1999) and Hilton (Hilton 2003) proposed this character for their phylogenies of Osteoglossomorpha. Our character states (2) and (3) are identical to their character states 0 and 1. We have modified their character state 2 as well as Hilton"-™s state 3 (nasals gutter-like or irregularly subrectangular; nasals flat and broad) to discriminate between approximately rectangular and approximately triangular nasals, which are clearly different character states in our taxonomic sample ((0) and (1), respectively).^n';

In contrast, most teleosts have the nasals located lateral to the most anterior portion of the frontals and/or the ossifications of the ethmoidal region (e.g. mesethmoid, supraethmoid, (Arratia 2000b, Pal"¤ontol Z.),(Arratia 1997), as observed in basal teleosts, such as "- Pholidophorus gervasuttii, "- Siemensichthys macrocephalus, and "- Dorsetichthys bechei (Arratia 2013), as well as in most teleocephalans. This is also the condition present in "- Luisiella feruglioi. As an exception among the teleocephalan taxa included in the present analysis, the nasal bones are in contact at the midline in the osteoglossomorph Heterotis (Li & Wilson 1996),(Li & Wilson 1999),(Hilton 2003). This condition occurs frequently in basal neopterygians but not in teleosts and was considered by Li and Wilson (Li & Wilson 1999) and posteriorly by Hilton (Hilton 2003) as secondarily derived in osteoglossomorphs. ^nIn amiids and lepisosteiforms the nasals join at the midline (Grande & Bemis 1998),(Grande 2010) but in aspidorhynchiforms these bones are separated by the frontals and the large rostral ossification (Brito 1997),(Maisey 1991) whereas in pachycormiforms they are mainly separated by a rostrodermethmoid ossification (Mainwaring  1978).^nThese different conditions of the nasal bones have been represented in binary characters several times by scoring the presence/absence of nasals separated by the rostrodermethmoid (Arratia 2000a, Mitt Mus Natkd Berl Geowiss Reihe.), the presence/absence of nasals separated by the frontals (Arratia 2000b, Pal"¤ontol Z.), or nasals in contact along the midline versus nasals separated by the frontals (Arratia 2013). Li and Wilson (Grande & Poyato-Ariza 1999) used a similar character distinguishing three character states: nasal bones in contact at the midline, separated by the frontals, and separated by the mesethmoid. We do not agree with this character because we consider that the separation of the nasals is independent from the bone or bones that occupy the area left between the separated nasals in the different taxa. ^n';

The supraoccipital crest is hypertrophied in the gonorynchiforms Chanos and "- Tharrhias, in which it projects caudally forming a posteriorly pectinate blade (Grande & Poyato-Ariza 1999).  ^nThis character was used by Maisey (Maisey 1991) in his phylogenetic analysis of ichthyodectiforms, where he considered the presence/absence of a high, triangular supraoccipital crest (our state (2)). This author also included an additional character that refers to the size of the supraoccipital crest (character 17), but we think that this last character is not independent from the previous one. The occurrence of both a large and triangular supraoccipital crest and a small crest was coded by Stewart (Stewart 1999). Alvarado-Ortega (Alvarado-Ortega 2004) considered four binary presence/absence characters dealing with the shape and size of the supraoccipital crest (i.e. ch. 9, 33, 35 and 47) including the two proposed by Maisey, but we consider these characters are not independent from each other. On the other hand, our character definition is similar to character 13 of Grande and Poyato-Ariza (Grande & Poyato-Ariza 1999) although the latter included only three states (essentially our states (1), (2) and (3)). The character proposed by Grande and Poyato-Ariza was also modified by Cavin (Cavin 2001), who proposed a binary character for the occurrence of a small versus a large supraoccipital crest, projecting dorsally and/or posteriorly above the occipital region.

Hilton (Hilton 2003) noted that the state 1 of Li and Wilson (Li & Wilson 1996),(Li & Wilson 1999) included more than one possible condition for the shape of the extrascapular bone and, thus, discriminated between an expanded extrascapular bone, a reduced and irregularly shaped extrascapular bone, and a reduced and tubular extrascapular bone. Our observations indicate that there are two distinct conditions of expanded extrascapular bones in our sample (i.e. rostrally and caudally expanded) and that in most basal teleosts and elopomorphs lacking an expanded extrascapular the shape of this bone is not irregular but quadrangular or semicircular.^nOn the other hand, Arratia (Arratia 2008a, Geological Society) and Arratia and Tischlinger (Arratia & Tischlinger 2010) coded our character state (2) as a presence/absence character with an unspecified absence, relating the caudal expansion of the extrascapular to the posterior border of the opercle. We have chosen not to relate the shape of the extrascapular to the position of the opercle as we were not able to find any developmental or functional relationship between the extension of the former and the posterior margin of the latter; other taxa might have (not observed in this study) expanded extrascapulars but the position of the opercle is different from that of our sampled taxa.';

According to Grande (Grande 1985) two ossified bullae develop in the prootic and pterotic bones of clupeomorphs, respectively, as observed for example in the living Engraulis and Denticeps and in the fossil "- Santanaclupea (Grande 1985),(Maisey 1993). However, in some clupeomorphs the pterotic bone does not form a well-developed bulla, and this structure is only present in the prootic bone (e.g. "- Diplomystus in this analysis). The condition is unknown in most basal teleosts and fossil teleocephalans, including "- Luisiella feruglioi. Extant elopomorphs, osteoglossomorphs, ostariophysans, and euteleosts lack an ossified bulla in the prootic (Grande 1985),(Patterson & Rosen 1977),(Greenwood, Rosen, Weitzman & Myers  1966), with the only exception of "- Erichalcis, which is considered a clupeomorph by Forey (Forey 1975) and Grande (Grande 1985), but a euteleost by Arratia (Arratia 1999). According to Greenwood et al. (Greenwood, Rosen, Weitzman & Myers  1966), Patterson and Rosen (Patterson & Rosen 1977), and Grande (Grande 1985), the occurrence of a bulla is related to the presence of an otophysic connection involving a diverticulum of the swimbladder that penetrates the exoccipital and extends into the prootic within the lateral wall of the braincase. The otophysic connections (i.e. between the swimbladder and the inner ear) are achieved through the development of two large vesicles at each side of the braincase, which originate from the bifurcation of the left and right swimbladder diverticula and are lodged in the bullae (Greenwood, Rosen, Weitzman & Myers  1966).^nAll cited authors scored the presence of an otophysic connection for this character. However, since to date no fossil has preserved the swimbladder diverticula, which are the organs actually involved in the otophysic connection, we prefer scoring the presence or absence of ossified bullae, which is the attribute that can be assessed in fossil specimens.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=11 TEXT='Modified from Brito (1997: chs. 5 and 6), Patterson & Rosen (1977: ch. 5), Patterson (1977a, Plenum Press: ch. 20)^n^nThe posttemporal fossa is a depression located in the occiput of most neopterygians. In these fishes, the fossa is open laterally and houses the anterior extension of the trunk musculature (Gardiner & Schaeffer 1989). A similar fossa is present in some basal actinopterygians where it opens laterally (e.g. Acipenser, "- Saurichthys) but does not house musculature. On the other hand, the fossa Bridgei is an internal depression located in the otic region of the skull and related to the posterior semicircular canal. In aspidorhynchiforms, Triassic and Lower Jurassic "-''pholidophoriforms"--, as well as in "- Dorsetichthys bechei the fossa Bridgei and the posttemporal fossa are separated from each other by a thin wall of bone, whereas in Amia, "- Pachycormus, and most teleosts the two fossae are confluent. In the latter two cases, the anterior portion of the trunk musculature extends into the otic region of the skull occupying both posttemporal fossa and fossa Bridgei (Patterson 1977a, Plenum Press),(Patterson 1975). In contrast, in Amia the axial muscles extend anteriorly occupying only the posttemporal fossa. ^nA posttemporal fossa is absent in Lepisosteus (Grande 2010) and in clupeid clupeomorphs (Grande 1985),(Greenwood, Rosen, Weitzman & Myers  1966). Several authors have largely debated its occurrence in osteoglossomorphs and the issue remains unsolved. Ridewood (Ridewood 1904), Greenwood (Greenwood 1970), and later Li and Wilson (Li & Wilson 1996) considered that the temporal fenestra of osteoglossomorphs might be homologous to the preepiotic fossa of clupeoids, and that a posttemporal fossa would be absent in these groups of fishes. On the other hand, Taverne (Taverne 1977a, Acad Roy Belgique Cl Sci Collect.),(Taverne 1998) used both the posttemporal and temporal fossae as synonyms in his descriptions of osteoglossomorph fishes.  In addition, the author proposed that the temporal fenestra of osteoglossomorphs resulted from a transformation of the posttemporal fossa of elopids and basal teleosts, mainly based on the presence of the epiotic, pterotic, and exoccipital bones participating in both fossae in basal teleosts and in notopterids and mormyroids among osteoglossomorph taxa. However, and according to their hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships within osteoglossomorphs, Cavin and Forey (Cavin & Forey 2001) and Hilton (Hilton 2003),(Hilton 2002) discarded Taverne"-™s proposal by arguing that the presence of a temporal fenestra framed by those bones is a derived condition for Osteoglossomorpha and that it corresponds to a different depression. Considering these arguments and the lack of consensus, this character has been coded as (?) for the three osteoglossomorph taxa included in this analysis. ^nThis character was proposed by Patterson (Patterson 1977a, Plenum Press) and Patterson and Rosen (Patterson & Rosen 1977), who considered our states (1) and (2) only. Patterson (Patterson 1977a, Plenum Press) also distinguished the invasion of the trunk musculature in both posttemporal fossa and fossa Bridgei from the particular condition of Amia, in which these fossae are confluent but only the epaxial musculature occupies the posttemporal fossa. In the same derived state this author included the case where both fossae are separated and the case of Amia. We did not follow this argument because whether the trunk musculature occupied either fossae or not in fossil teleosts cannot be determined unambiguously.^n^n12- Bones participating in the posttemporal fossa: epiotic, pterotic and exoccipital (0); epiotic, pterotic, exoccipital and intercalar (1); epiotic, pterotic and parietal (2) (modified from (Arratia 2008a, Geological Society): ch. 188, (Arratia & Tischlinger 2010): ch. 177)^nThe posttemporal fossa may be framed by different bones in different groups of teleosts or even within a same group of teleosts, as it occurs among euteleosts. This fossa is framed by the epiotic, pterotic and exoccipital bones in most basal teleosts like "- Siemensichthys macrocephalus, "- Dorsetichthys bechei, "- Leptolepis coryphaenoides (Patterson 1975), and in elopomorphs (Forey 1973). In particular, the epiotic, pterotic, exoccipital, and intercalar participate in the formation of a roofed posttemporal fossa in the Jurassic and Cretaceous teleosts "- Notelops, "- Rhacolepis, "- Goulmimichthys, "- Apsopelix, and "- Luisichthys (Arratia 2008a, Geological Society),(Cavin 2001),(Forey 1977). In contrast, in the euteleost and ostariophysan taxa included in this analysis the posttemporal fossa is framed by the epiotic, pterotic, and parietal bones (e.g. Thymallus, Oncorhynchus, "- Humbertia, Chanos, Opsariichthys; (Patterson 1970)-(Sanford 2000)). The condition is unknown in "- Luisiella feruglioi, aspidorhynchiforms, and pachycormiforms. Finally, Amia has a posttemporal fossa framed by the epiotic and dermopterotic (Grande & Bemis 1998). Although the later is homologous (in part) with the pterotic of teleosts (which results from the fusion of dermopterotic and autopterotic bones) we are not certain whether the region of the pterotic, which frames the posttemporal fossa in teleosts, corresponds to the dermopterotic portion of the bone and, therefore, the character is coded as unknown for Amia.   ^nThis character has been modified from that used by Arratia (Arratia 2008a, Geological Society) and Arratia and Tischlinger (Arratia & Tischlinger 2010) because these analyses only scored the presence/absence of our state (1), remaining the absence state unspecified.

According to Patterson (Patterson 1975) in many basal actinopterygians (e.g. Polypterus) and in the basal teleosts "- Dorsetichthys bechei and "- Leptolepis coryphaenoides there is a completely closed, ossified canal for the passage of the dorsal aorta that is formed by ventral projections of the basioccipital bone. In contrast, in the basal teleosts "- Siemensichthys macrocephalus and "- Pachycormus this artery passes through a distinct median groove excavated in the ventral surface of the basioccipital.

According to several authors (e.g. (Patterson 1975),(Allis 1919),(Gardiner 1985)) in most teleosts the dorsal aorta bifurcates in two lateral aortae before entering the braincase. The backward migration of the bifurcation of the median dorsal aorta is probably related to the enlargement of the circulus cephalicus (or lengthening of the lateral aortae) that characterizes teleostean fishes (Allis 1919),(Goodrich 1930) and might have resulted in the shortening or obliteration of the aortic canal in this group (Gardiner 1985). According to Allis (Allis 1919) and Hilton (Hilton 2002), the basioccipital of the basal osteoglossomorph Hiodon has a distinct aortic groove along its ventral surface. The condition of "- Luisiella feruglioi is unknown.  ^nThis character was modified from several previous studies (Arratia 1999),(Arratia 2000a, Mitt Mus Natkd Berl Geowiss Reihe.),(Arratia 2000b, Pal"¤ontol Z.),(Arratia 2008a, Geological Society),(Arratia 1997),(Arratia & Tischlinger 2010),(Patterson & Rosen 1977),(Arratia 1994),(Arratia 1996),(Taverne 2001), because in all cases it was enunciated as a binary character where the presence/absence of an ossified aortic canal was coded, not describing the alternative conditions represented in our taxonomic sample. On the other hand, a similar character was used in the morphological analysis performed by Hurley et al. (Hurley et al 2007) to investigate the phylogeny of actinopterygians. This character included four possible states, three of which agree with our proposed states ((0), (1) and (2)), the additional state making reference to the condition of Acipenser (not included in the present analysis) where a parabasal canal for the dorsal aorta occurs between the parasphenoid and basioccipital.';

According to Patterson and Rosen (Patterson & Rosen 1977), two paired endoskeletal ossifications occur in ichthyodectiforms (i.e. lateral ethmoids and ethmopalatine bones) and also in some euteleots, like esocoids and cyprinoids (i.e. lateral ethmoids and proethmoid ossifications). Even though the authors suggested that ethmopalatine bones and proethmoid bones might be homologous, they clearly assessed their different morphology and topography and therefore, they regard them as unique specializations of each group.

In ostariophysans (e.g. Chanos, Brycon, "- Gordichthys; (Fink & Fink 1981)) the elongation is due to the separation of the quadrate and hyomandibular bones by a lengthening of the symplectic. In some extinct euteleosts (e.g. "- Leptolepides, "- Orthogonikleithrus; (Arratia 1997)) the elongation of the suspensorium is due to the occurrence of a cartilage (remanent of the hyosimplectic cartilage), which is placed between the hyomandibular bone and the symplectic. In some taxa, like the clupeomorphs "- Santanaclupea and Engraulis, an elongation of the suspensorium is caused by a different inclination of the hyomandibula, which is not vertically positioned but inclined in an anterodorsal to posteroventral direction (Arratia 1997),(Maisey 1993). In Lepisosteus and "- Obaichthys the quadrate is separated from the symplectic by the quadratojugal and besides, the symplectic is not in contact with the hyomandibular bone but with the preopercular bone, which in turn contacts the hyomandibular (Grande 2010),(Wiley 1976).^nArratia (Arratia 1999),(Arratia 2000a, Mitt Mus Natkd Berl Geowiss Reihe.),(Arratia 1997) proposed three different characters (see above) to describe the different conditions that may cause an elongation of the suspensorium in teleosts (our states (0), (1), (2) and (3)).

According to Arratia and Schultze (Arratia & Schultze 1990) in this fish the ventral portion of the hypohyal cartilage is ossified, corresponding to the ventral hypohyal of teleosts; in some adult individuals this cartilage exhibits a small posterodorsal ossification, which the authors identified as an incipient dorsal hypohyal. However, Grande and Bemis (Grande & Bemis 1998) argued that they did not find two pairs of hypohyals in Amia calva or in fossil amiids.

Also, we have excluded Arratia"-™s (Arratia 2013) irregularly-shaped condition because the maxilla of lepisosteids is extremely reduced, and fused to the most posterior toothed infraorbitals, and therefore, the shape of its posterior border cannot be described unambiguously.

As this condition describes mainly that of elopomorphs but not those of the remaining taxa (with or without trace of an ethmoidal commissure) and because it does not include a reference to other ethmoidal ossifications present in teleosts, we have modified the character in order to describe the different conditions present in our taxon sample. On the other hand, Li and Wilson (Li & Wilson 1999) proposed a character to record the presence or absence of an ethmoidal commissure within Osteoglossomorpha (their taxon sample).

In contrast, most ostariophysan taxa lack tooth plates covering the basibranchials 1-3, as observed in the cypriniform Opsariichthys (Fink & Fink 1981),(Fink & Fink 1996). Basibranchial 1-3 tooth plates are also absent in the branchial apparatus of Amia calva (Grande & Bemis 1998),(Nelson 1969), whereas these plates occur as paired elements in Lepisosteus (Wiley 1976),(Nelson 1969). The condition of most fossil teleosts (including "- Luisiella feruglioi) and more basal taxa incorporated in this analysis is unknown.^nA similar character was proposed by Patterson (Patterson 1977a, Plenum Press) including only our character states (1) and (2) and, thus, the absence of basibranchial tooth plates was not taken into account. Also, the author included in the definition of state (2) a reference to those cases where basibranchial tooth plates are not paired elements but smaller asymmetrical elements, a condition that occurs in basal actinopterygians (e.g. Polypterus).

Consequently, two distinct neural spines can be observed in the abdominal column of these taxa. This is the condition present in "- Luisiella feruglioi as well as in Amia, Lepisosteus, and the pycnodontid "- Mesturus (Grande & Bemis 1998),(Grande 2010),(Kriwet 2001). In contrast, fusion of these halves producing a median neural spine in the abdominal region occurs in many living teleocephalan taxa, like ostariophysans (e.g. Brycon, Chanos; (Grande & Poyato-Ariza 1999),(Weitzman 1962)), some clupeomorphs (e.g. Denticeps, Engraulis; (Grande 1985)), and osteoglossomorphs (e.g. Hiodon, Heterotis; (Hilton 2003),(Hilton 2002)).

Provided that two separate halves of the neural arches exist, two distinct neural spines are present in each vertebra of the abdominal region of the column.

This is the condition present in the anterior axial skeleton of "- Luisiella feruglioi and in the taxa included in the outgroup. However, in ostariophysan taxa the first pleural rib is greatly modified (Fink & Fink 1981),(Rosen & Greenwood 1970). In gonorynchiform ostariophysans, and in comparison with the following ribs and with the same element of other groups of teleosts, this rib is expanded proximally and it is shortened in length distally (Grande & Poyato-Ariza 1999),(Maisey 1991). Also in these fishes, the parapophysis of the third vertebra is anteriorly elongated. In contrast, in otophysans (i.e. characiforms, siluriforms, cypriniforms and gymnotiforms; (Fink & Fink 1981)) both the parapophysis and rib of the third vertebral centrum are greatly expanded proximally and anteriorly elongated. Besides, the rib is blunt distally, and forms a thin, curved posterior process (termed the transformator process), which is attached to the gasbladder. The resulting ossification, which is part of the Webberian apparatus, is named the tripus and is a unique feature of otophysans (Fink & Fink 1981),(Rosen & Greenwood 1970).

The epineurals are absent in acantomorph euteleosts (not included in this analysis) as well as in the outgroup taxa. In non-teleostean actinopterygian fishes, short epineurals occur only in a few taxa, like some palaeoniscoids, the chondrostean "- Boreosomus, and the amiiform "- Caturus (De Pinna 1996),(Pattreson & Johnson 1995),(Patterson 1977b, Academic Press).

We consider that the enunciation of these characters is ambiguous, because it is uncertain whether the absence of elongated, solid epineural processes on neural arches represents the absence of epineurals, or the presence of epineurals of other characteristics. On the other hand, and referring to the "-''other condition"-- state, as explained by Patterson and Johnson (Pattreson & Johnson 1995), teleostean epineurals may be fused to the neural arches, articulate with the corresponding arch or be joined to the neural arch by a ligament, but in all cases the epineurals are elongated, solid bones.';

This is also the condition found in lepisosteoid lepisosteiforms (sensu L"³pez-Arbarello (L"³pez-Arbarello 2012)) as well as aspidorynchiforms (Brito 1997), whereas the dorsal fin is placed above the abdominal and caudal regions and posterior to the pelvic fins in amiids (Grande & Bemis 1998).^nThe present character combines two previously proposed characters, one referring to the posterior placement of dorsal and anal fins and another to the occurrence of a dorsal fin origin anterior to that of pelvic fins (Arratia 1999),(Arratia 2000a, Mitt Mus Natkd Berl Geowiss Reihe.),(Arratia 2000b, Pal"¤ontol Z.),(Arratia 2008a, Geological Society),(Arratia 1997),(Arratia & Tischlinger 2010). Because the occurrence of a posteriorly placed dorsal fin is reliant on a dorsal fin origin posterior to pelvic fins, we have chosen to combine these two characters in order to avoid dependence of traits. Stewart (Stewart 1999) proposed a different character with three states, one coding a dorsal fin placed well ahead of anal fin (similar but not equal to our states (0) and (2) because the relative position of the dorsal fin with respect to the pelvic fins is not determined) and other two states referring to a short, remote dorsal fin opposed to a long, falcate anal fin or to a short anal fin (also coded by Alvarado-Ortega (Alvarado-Ortega 2004)). These states include information about size and position of the fins that have been treated separatedly herein. Finally, Arratia (Arratia 2013) proposed a character (similar but not equal to our state (1)) where the presence of posteriorly placed dorsal fin, closer to caudal fins than to pelvic fins is coded.';

In a dorsal fin with straight margin the fin rays gradually decrease in length in a rostral to caudal direction, whereas in that with a convex margin the rays decrease in length from the middle of the fin to both anterior and posterior ends. Dorsal fins of these characteristics are found in most basal as well as living teleosts, including "- Luisiella feruglioi.

	TEXT CHARACTER=120 TEXT='In teleosts, the dorsal fin is composed of two different types of rays: procurrent rays and principal rays. Procurrent rays are located anteriorly in the fin and are followed by the principal rays (Arratia 2008b, Mesozoic Fishes 4). In non-teleostean neopterygians fringing fulcra might also occur in the dorsal fin, being located on the leading margin of the fin. There are generally one to three unsegmented procurrent rays in teleostean dorsal fins and, unlike dorsal principal rays which have a one to one relationship with proximal pterygiophores, they all articulate with the first proximal pterygiophore; in some taxa also the first principal ray articulates with the first proximal pterygiophore. According to Arratia (Arratia 2008b, Mesozoic Fishes 4) the most common condition in the most basal teleosts is the one in which the first dorsal pterygiophore articulates only with the procurrent rays, as observed in Elops, Hiodon, Brycon, "- Leptolepides haertesi, Umbra (Weitzman 1962),(Arratia 1997), among many others.

However, the members of the extinct order "- Ichthyodectiformes have a long, falcate anal fin (supported by c. 20 pterygiophores or even more; (Maisey 1991),(Patterson & Rosen 1977)). In this fin, a concave margin is defined by the occurrence of a few long anterior rays, followed by many shorter rays that decrease in length gradually (see for example "- Allothrissops, "- Thrissops; (Patterson & Rosen 1977),(Taverne 1977b, Geobios)). The outgroup taxa have an anal fin with a straight or slightly convex margin. ^nPatterson and Rosen (Patterson & Rosen 1977) proposed the occurence of a long, falcate anal fin, opposed to a short, remote dorsal fin as a synapomorphy of "- Ichthyodectiformes. Thereupon the occurrence of this attribute (so defined) has been used in several phylogenetic analyses including ichthyodectiforms (e.g. (Arratia 1999),(Arratia 2000a, Mitt Mus Natkd Berl Geowiss Reihe.),(Arratia 2008a, Geological Society),(Arratia 1997),(Maisey 1991),(Arratia & Tischlinger 2010)).

However, in all cases, the character definition includes more than one trait for two different fins (morphology, length, and position of dorsal and anal fins) that might be independent from one another.

The authors distinguished this condition from that present in osteoglossomorphs, where there are three or even four uroneurals extending rostrally beyond the U2.  According to Arratia (Arratia 2008a, Geological Society),(Arratia 1997) and our observations, there are also only two uroneurals extending beyond the U2 in the varasichthyid "- Protoclupea, and the Cretaceous "- Notelops, whereas most basal teleosts including "- Luisiella feruglioi and the aspidorhynchiforms "- Aspidorhynchus and "- Belonostomus (Brito 1997) have three or more uroneurals extending beyond the U2 (e.g. "- Leptolepis coryphaenoides, "- Tharsis dubius, ichthyodectiforms).

A somewhat different character definition was given by Arratia (Arratia 1991) and Arratia and Tischlinger (Arratia & Tischlinger 2010), who included as states other possible conditions for this character (e.g. two or one uroneural extending forward beyond U2, stegural extending forward beyond U2).

In particular, the uroneurals of the extinct order "- Ichthyodectiformes (e.g. "- Allothrissops, "- Thrissops, "- Cladocyclus) are placed laterally to the preural and ural vertebrae of the caudal skeleton and, therefore, the lateral surfaces of the centra are not exposed, as they are covered by these ossifications (Maisey 1991),(Alvarado-Ortega 2004),(Patterson & Rosen 1977). Although this latter condition has been proposed as a unique synapomorphy of "- Ichthyodectiformes by Patterson and Rosen (Patterson & Rosen 1977), it also occurs in the Cretaceous non-ichthyodectiform teleosts "- Apsopelix and "- Crossognathus (Taverne 1989),(Teller-Marshall & Bardack 1978). ^nMaisey (Maisey 1991) and later Alvarado-Ortega (Alvarado-Ortega 2004) proposed a character to code the presence or absence of anterior uroneurals extending anteroventrally over the sides of preural centra (the latter author referred to the uroneurals covering the lateral surfaces of preural centra). Although it is similar to our state (1), their character definition did not include a reference to the covering of the ural centra, which are also laterally covered.
