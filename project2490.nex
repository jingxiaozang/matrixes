When o.i. development is very weak, then this basically describes the internal costal development of "alveoli".^n^nDO NOT CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A STRUTTED PROCESS YET.';

	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='See Theriot (1992. Systematic Biology).  Most species either always have just one rimoportula (also called labiate process or LP), or LP number is correlated with valve diameter.  A very few (maybe just one species) always has two LPs.';
