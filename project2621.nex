        [Character comments]
        	TEXT CHARACTER=1 TEXT='Measured as maximum width of frontal lobe in percent of maximum cephalic width (identical to cranidial width in phacopids). Since the maximum width of the frontal lobe coincides with the position of the facial sutures, this character can be measured on cranidia as well as on cephala.^nOntogeny. The ratio changes only little during growth. In Acernaspis it appears to show an insignificant decrease or to be stable ( + a few percent) from inferred late meraspid^nstages. In Ananaspis there may be a similarly insignificant slight increase. In Devonian^nphacopids with wide frontal lobes this feature shows an increase in relative width during^nontogeny. In Calyptaulax there is an increase during the meraspid period, but from early^nholaspid stages the width changes little or not at all.^nOutgroup comparison. Podowrinella and some Calyptaulax may reach close to 60%, as does^nMorgatia. Other outgroups usually show low ratios.^nPolarity. An intermediate glabella is regarded as primitive (character state 2).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=2 TEXT='Sagittal length from posterior margin of ring to the deepest part ofthe occipital furrow^nmeasured as percent of sagittal cranidial length. Note: this ratio is influenced by the^nsagittal orientation of the specimen, so that when measurements are made on^nillustrations of specimens figured in exterior view, smaller ratios will be recovered^ncompared to when true dorsal views (i.e. perpendicular to the upper limit of the eye) are^nused.^nOntogeny. Details of the known ontogenetic development for certain Acernaspis species^nwere given by Ramskold (1988). Th e relative length of the occipital ring is nearly^nconstant during ontogeny, though there may sometimes be a weak trend towards a^nrelative shortening of the ring. In Devonian phacopids no consistent changes can be^nseen, and this is also true for Calyptaulax.^nOutgroup comparison. The length of the occipital ring is less than 20"--,, of the sagittal^ncranidial length in all outgroups.^nPolariry. A short occipital ring is considered primitive (character state 0).^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='Measured as distance between deepest parts of axial furrows along occipital ring.^nexpressed in percent of cephalic width (measured as in character 1).^nOntogeny. This character was discussed hy Ramskiild (1988) under character A. In^nSilurian taxa there appears to be a general trend during ontogeny towards a relati1.r^nwidening of the occipital ring. Meraspid specimens of Devonian phacopids have a much narrower occipital ring than adults. This is also the case in Calyptaulax.^nOutgroup comparison. Some Calyptaulax may approach 35% ,Podowrinella straitonensis just exceeds 30%, other outgroups have even narrower occipital rings.^nPolarity. A narrow occipital ring is regarded as primitive (character state 0).^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='The shape of the intercalating ring varies considerably among the phacopid taxa^nunder study here, and it has not been possible to divide the nearly continuous range of variation into easily distinguished, discrete states. Only two extreme varieties are clearly set off from the remaining morphological spectrum. State 1 below therefore includes widely different forms.^nOntogeny. Late meraspid and early holaspid stages of both Silurian and Devonian taxa possess an intercalating ring broadly comparable in size and shape to the occipital ring^nand also to L2. During later ontogeny the ring undergoes a relative decrease in size, and its shape usually changes considerably.^nOutgroup comparison. All outgroups have a large intercalating ring.^nPolarity. Large intercalating ring is regarded as primitive (character state 1)^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='The shape of Ll varies considerably among phacopid trilobites, and this feature is of much taxonomic use at the species level. It is difficult both to subdivide the variation into discrete character states, and to code the species unambiguously. Much of this difficulty arises from the fact that the amounts of coating and light during photography will influence the extent of L1 visible on photographs. This is particularly true for species with a small, depressed L1. Both the character state list below and the coding of many taxa is therefore somewhat arbitrary.^nOntogeny. In meraspides of Devonian phacopids L1 is large, near level with the occipital ring and L2, and poorly separated from the intercalating ring. During later ontogeny of Silurian and Devonian species there is a reduction in relative size of L1, and the lobe also becomes more depressed and usually becomes well separated from the intercalating ring by an exsagittal furrow.^nOutgroup comparison. Eomonorachines (sensu Ludvigsen and Chatterton, 1982) usually have a small, occasionally medium-sized L1. Other pterygometopids, as well as all other phacopaceans have a large Ll.^nPolarity. Small Ll is regarded as primitive (character state 0).^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='The length of L2 is measured as the maximum distance between the posterior edge of L2 and S2, taken perpendicular to the width of L2. The length of L3 is the maximum distance between S2 and the proximal part of S3 taken perpendicular to a bisector between these furrows. There is usually some angular difference between these two measurements.^nOntogenv. In Silurian taxa L2 is relatively shorter in juveniles than in adults. This appears to he the case also in the few Devonian species where the ontogenetic development of S2 and S3 can be followed.^nOutgroup comparison. Podowrinella has an intermediate state (3). No detailed measurements can be made of L3 in the other outgroups due to the different course of S2 in these, so the ratio L2/L3 cannot be calculated. L2 is, however, large in most of these outgroups, the eomonorachine Tricopelta being the only notable exception.^nPolarity. The scant evidence indicates that an intermediate state (character state 3 J is primitive.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=7 TEXT='Presence or absence of granulation has been repeatedly used for taxonomic purposes in phacopid studies (e.g. Campbell, 1967, 1977; Lesperance and Letendre, 1981), and the general trend during the Silurian and Devonian of a directional change in the granulation has been recognized consciously or unconsciously by many phacopid workers. Apart from variations in granule size on various parts of the exoskeleton, there is also a wide size range included in the unifying term "-''granulation"--. Taking for example the frontal lobe, many Acernaspis species, particularly early ones, have a barely perceptible granulation with individual granules only 20-25 micrometers across, while granules^non late Llandovery species and many Ananaspis are 40-50 micrometers in diameter. Many^nAcernaspis species have been described as "-''smooth"-- because of inadequate preservation, preparation, or study, whereas they are in fact granulated.^nOntogeny. Little is known of the development of granulation during the ontogeny.^nFrom the Acernaspis material described by Ramskold ( 1988) it appears that granulation is present at least as early as in early holaspid stages. The size of the granules remains fairly constant during later ontogeny, thus giving the surface a successively smoother appearance. In Calyptaulax granulation is present already in the protaspid stages.^nOutgroup comparison. All outgroups possess granulation, except a few, highly^nautapomorphic species such as Calyptaulax glabella, which are apparently smooth.^nPolarity. Presence of granulation regarded as primitive (character state 0).^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=8 TEXT='Presence of glabellar tubercles in adult phacopids is widespread, and their presence or absence has commonly been used to define genera. "-''Tubercle"-- is used here in a general sense, with no attempt to distinguish between the various types described by Miller (1976) or Stormer (1980). The distinction of these types is based on thin section studies, which are outside the scope of this paper. Tubercles are instead grouped into classes based on their height, distribution and surface sculpture. These classes grade into each other, and the coding for some species may be more or less arbitrary.^nOntogeny. In Acernaspis tubercles are present in juveniles, but are gradually reduced in prominence during ontogeny, and are lost in adults. The indifferent preservation of the available phacopid ontogenetic material precludes a more precise description of the development of the tubercles. The presence of paired glabellar tubercles in Acernaspis juveniles similar to those in meraspid Calyptaulax does, however, indicate that the development is similar in these taxa, i.e., in later ontogeny additional tuberculation is added to a basic pattern of symmetrically distributed tubercles.^nOutgroup comparison. A small number of eomonorachine species lack tuberculation. These include Podowrinella straitonensis (but not P. christiei) and Calyptaulax glabella. All other outgroups have a tuberculated glabella. In most of these the glabella carries a distinct, medium dense to dense tuberculation.^nPolaritv. Absence of tuberculation is regarded as primitive (character state 0).^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=9 TEXT='There is a continuous range of development of this feature, from an unelevated spot of slightly denser granulation to a backwardly curving spine.^nOntogenv. In Acernaspis a node is present in juveniles, but is usually lost in adults. An occipital node is also present in all other figured early stages of phacopids, but is commonly lost in later stages. In Calvptaulax a node is present in protaspides and^nmeraspides, but is subsequently lost in holaspides.^nOutgroup comparison. The presence of an occipital node is common, but irregularly distributed among the outgroups. Ramskold (1988) regarded the outgroup evidence as inconclusive, and gave no polarity preference. Podowrinella and Calvptaulax lack an occipital node.^nPolarity. Absence of node is here regarded as primitive (character state 0).^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=10 TEXT='The furrows may be circumscribed by elevated rims. These are usually expressed in a^ndenser granulation, though they sometimes form a raised height surrounding the margin^nof the furrows. They may or may not be visible on photographs, according to the^nphotographic technique applied, and the coding may be erroneous in some cases where^nphotographs were used.^nOntogeny. From the material of Ramskold (1988) it appears that these rims are absent^nin early stages, and start to develop only in near-adult, holaspid stages.^nOutgroup comparison.

	TEXT CHARACTER=11 TEXT='The cheek between the eye and the posterior border furrow was termed the postocular^narea by Chlupac (1977). Its exsagittal length indicates the eye position, and is one ofthc^nmost variable features in phacopid trilobites. Its length is here compared to the exsagittal^nlength of the posterior border directly behind the postocular area. There is almost no^nvariation during ontogeny in the length of the posterior border relative to the size of the^ncephalon, and the ratio postocular area/posterior border can therefore be determined by^nthe position of the posterior margin of the eye.^nOntogeny. This is a feature that undergoes strong and uniformly directed change^nduring the ontogeny of phacopids as well as many other trilobites. The eyes originate in^nthe protaspide at the very margin of the cephalon, anteriorly near the glabella, and they^nthen migrate posteriorly during meraspid and holaspid stages, parallel to an increase in^neye size. This pattern is known both from Acernaspis and Devonian phacopid species, as^nwell as from outgroups (e.g. Calyptaulax).^nOutgroup comparison. Most outgroups have a long postocular area. The eomonorachines^nare an exception, commonly having a short postocular area.^nPolarity. Short postocular area is regarded as primitive (character state 0).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=12 TEXT='Only the part of the furrow posterior to the facial suture is coded, since the furrow,^nwhen present, is either fading or indistinct anterior to this. It is not clear if the furrow in^nViaphacops and Phacops is entirely homologous with the border furrow in earlier^nphacopids.^nOntogeny. The furrow is present in juvenile Acernaspis specimens, but gets progressively^nshallower during ontogeny, and is eventually completely lost in most species. In^nAnanaspis and Devonian phacopids the furrow is retained also in adults. This is also the^ncase in many Calyptaulax.^nOutgroup comparison. Almost all outgroups possess distinct lateral border furrows.^nExceptions are non-tuberculate Calyptaulas species. Podowrinella possesses a distinct^nlateral border furrow.^nPolarity. Presence of a narrow and deep lateral border furrow is regarded as primitivt^n(character state 2).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=13 TEXT='The part of the cheek bounded anterolaterally by the palpebral furrow and the axial^nfurrow, and merging posteriorly with the postocular area, was termed the palpebral area^nby Chlupac (1977). The height of this area in true frontal view (sensu Clarkson 1966)^ncompared to the height of the palpebral lobe is a good indication of the degree of^ninflation of the palpebral area.^nOntogeny. From the Acernaspis material described by Ramskold (1988) it seems that the^npalpebral area is slightly more inflated in juveniles than in adults. The preservation of^nthe small amount of pre-adult material of phacopid trilobites does not, however, permit^nany firm conclusions to be drawn.^nOutgroup comparison. All outgroups have a depressed palpebral area, with the exception^nof some autapomorphic Calyptaulax species (e.g. C. glabella).^nPolarity. A low palpebral area is regarded as primitive (character state 0).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=14 TEXT='The depth of the axial furrow along Ll varies greatly, though the photographic^ntechnique used influences the depth impression on a photograph.

Most outgroups possess large genal spines in adults. Exceptions^nare some common orachines (Podowrinella, Calyptaulax).

The ontogeny of this feature is unknown in the Phacopidae. In Calyptaulax^nannulata the pits are only visible in the largest specimen figured by Shaw (1968), so it is^nprobable that this feature appears late in ontogeny in general.^nOutgroup comparison. Outgroups rarely possess pits or granulation-free spots in this^narea.

Since^nthese pits cannot be seen in other illustrations of equally well preserved, silicified^nspecimens of the latter species (Hu, 1971), apparently due to the lesser magnification^nused, it may well be that pits are present also in some other taxa, though not detectable^nfrom illustrations. Tiny pits appear to he present in Podowrinella christiei (Lane. 1988,^npl. 4, fig. 2b; information available too late for inclusion in data matrix).^nPolarity.
