There is no distinct discontinuity between the two extremes, but when the border is wide enough to carry granulation/tuberculation it is coded as wide.^nOntogeny. The width of the border decreases during ontogeny (Selenopeltis, Ceratocephala) or is persistently wide (Ceratocephalina).^nPolarity. A wide border is regarded as primitive (state 0).';

This was noted already by Whittington (1956a, p. 243). Elongate depressions run anterolaterally from posterior to this protuberance to merge with S2.^nOntogeny. The swelling and furrows are absent in early meraspides of Ceratocephala, but present from later meraspid stages onward. They are absent in Selenopeltis and Ceratocephalina.^nPolarity. Absence of swelling and furrows is regarded as primitive (state 0).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='The subdivision of Selenopeltis of L1 into three sublobes has long been recognised. Such a division is also present in most other selenopeltine genera though it has, to my knowledge, never been described or discussed for this group. It has been stated that ''odontopleurids show no sign of the subdivision of L1 [present in lichids]'' (Thomas & Holloway 1988, p. 246), though at least five authors have commented on its occurrence in various acidaspidines and odontopleurines (see below). I will here attempt to demonstrate the presence and homology of this subdivision in the whole group.^nThe tripartite division of L1 in the Selenopeltinae and Ceratocephalinae is illustrated here for Selenopeltis, Dicranurus, Miraspis, Ceratonurus, and Ceratocephala (Fig. 6). A terminology for these sublobes was introduced by Snajdr (1984a; fig. 6) for Selenopeltis. However, the sublobation of L1 in odontopleurids may be homologous with that in lichids, and, whether correct or not, the terminology introduced by Sdzuy (1979) for the glabellar lobes in lichids can be unambiguously applied also to odontopleurids. Snajdr''s exterior, interior and anterior sublobes of L1 correspond to Sdzuy''s L1a, L1b and L1c, respectively. No sublobes of L2 are present in lichids and Snajdr''s terms ''exterior and interior sublobe'', although appropriate, are not used here. The advantages of a consistent system necessitates the introduction here of the terms L2a (''interior'') and L2b (''exterior'') for these sublobes. From the functional morphologist''s point of view, the lobes are features secondary to the furrows, since on the ventral side at least the apodemal parts of the furrows represent muscle attachment areas, and the lobes are simply the areas between these. This was noted by Sdzuy (1979). The structure of L1 can, however, be more accurately described in terms of lobes, which are defined by a periphery, than by using furrows, which merge with other furrows in both directions. It is important, however, to bear in mind that when lobes are described as present or absent, what is in fact described is the presence or absence of muscle attachment lines, each representing an individual muscle or muscle caput. It is highly likely that the external configuration of each lobe does not in itself reflect any particular underlying, separate structure in the soft tissues. The presence or distinctness of the sublobes of L1 and L2 in selenopeltine and ceratocephaline genera is as follows:^nLaethoprusia: No subdivision can be discerned. ^nKoneprusia: If the cranidium referred to K. fuscina by Vanfik and Pek (1987) is correctly assigned, there may be a very tiny L1c present in that species.^nIsoprusia: A small L2b can occasionally be recognized in I.mydlakia Bruton (1966a; pi. 55, figs 1, 8 and pi. 57, fig. 13). In the same species what must be the axial furrow is widened around the posterolateral corner of L1, and there is a small convexity in the furrow which may be an incipient L1a (or the vestige of one). L1c appears not to be developed.^nSelenopeltoides: L1 appears to be undivided in S. hawlei (see Snajdr 1986a) and 5. barbarus (Thomas, 1981) (Fig. 10), though in 5. ultima (see Howells 1982) L1c is distinct. In all three species L2 is weakly divided into L2a and L2b.^nCeratonurus (Fig. 6a): L1c is well defined, and there is a very small L1a (Bruton 1968a; pi. 9, fig. 1; Ormiston 1968; pi. 158, fig. 9). L2 is large but apparently undivided. Dicranurus (Fig. 6b): In Silurian and Devonian species the five sublobes of L1 and L2 are usually distinct. The division of L2 is sometimes virtually absent (Fig. 5a). In the only Ordovician species, D. oviformis, L1c is large and L2a and L2b are distinct (Lu & Chang 1974; pi. 54, fig. 4). L1a may be absent (Zhou et al. 1984, fig. 8i).^nMiraspis (Fig. 6c): All five sublobes of L1 and L2 are usually well developed, though L1a may be indistinct or absent, as in M. mira (see Snajdr 1988a; pi. 2, fig. 4), and the dividing furrow of L2 is usually very shallow.^nCeratocephalina: In C. tricornis (see Bruton 1968a) there is a very weak transverse depression one third of the way from the anterior margin of L1 that may delimit L1c, and in C. charlesworthi Chatterton and Perry, 1983 there is a weak furrow about midway on L1. If these furrows are homologous with the furrow that defines L1c in other selenopeltines, then this lobe is very large in Ceratocephalina. In C. vexilla Chatterton, 1971 (pi. 13, fig. 20) L1 and L2 are indistinctly delimited, but there are clearly a number of shallow, transverse furrows in this area, indicating subdivision of one or both lobes. Proceratocephala: A small L1c is sometimes present in the anterolateral corner of L1 (Kielan 1960; pi. 3, fig. 3). L2 is undivided.^nSelenopeltis (Fig. 6d, e): All five sublobes of L1 and L2 are^ndistinct in all species of Selenopeltis. In species with occipital spines L1a is usually smaller than in non-spined species, and the ''inter-sublobal'' furrows weaker.^nCeratocara: L1c is distinct in some species (Dean 1974; pi. 42, fig. 1; pi. 44, fig. 6; Norford 1981; pi. 11,fig.1). There is no L1a, and L2 is undivided.^nOrphanaspis: The glabella is unknown.^nCeratocephala. In Ceratocephala (Figs. 6f and 7d-g) the division of L1 is more complicated than in selenopeltines, and there may be more than one possible interpretation of the various lobes and furrows. It appears that the division of L1 has been carried to an extreme, so that in late forms L1a and L1c have merged with the fixed cheek, and only L1b is circumscribed by furrows. This cannot be deduced from advanced Ceratocephala, but some Ordovician species provide indications for this subdivision.^nFirst some ontogenetic considerations must be made. Cheek tubercles A1-A3 (of Whittington 1956a) can be traced throughout the ontogeny of several Ceratocephala. A1-A3 are in these, as in other trilobites, set on the fixed cheek, never on the glabellar lobes. This gives a definite limit for how far laterally the axial furrow may be positioned (though it may of course be in any position adaxial to these tubercles). Locating A1-A3 in C. triacantheis (Fig. 2; Chatterton 1980; pi. 19), we find in the earliest meraspides that Al and A3 are set on an exsagittal line, while A2 is more laterally set (Fig. 2b, c; Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, figs 2 and 10). In slightly later meraspides Al has moved relatively more laterally, so that the curve A1-A2-A3 is less strongly convex outward (Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, figs 3 and 5). In still later specimens, Al is the most abaxially placed of the three (Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 15).^nThe lateral glabellar lobes appear parallel to this development. L1 appears to occupy about half the distance between the longitudinal furrow and the A1-A2-A3 line. There are now two possible interpretations. Either L1 is expressed only as a well-defined lobe adjacent to the median lobe, or it occupies the cheek lateral to this as well, as far as immediately adaxial to the A1-A2-A3 line. The first interpretation has not previously been questioned, but indications are given below that the second one may be correct.^nTwo species are of particular interest in this respect, Ceratocephala exigua Whittington, 1963 and C. laticapitata Warburg, 1925. In the Middle Ordovician C. exigua the tubercles of the A1-A2-A3 line are la''rge and easy to identify (Whittington 1963; pi. 31, fig. 21). The axial furrow,^nor what may be interpreted as the axial furrow, runs posterolaterally from adjacent to L2 subparallel to, and close to, the A1-A2-A3 line. The area defined laterally by this furrow, defined anteriorly by SI, posteriorly by the occipital furrow and adaxially by the longitudinal furrow may constitute LI. The area is divided into three parts. The main portion is the inflated lobe usually taken to constitute LI. Anterolaterally to this is a smaller lobe of an elongate, curved drop-shape, widest anteriorly. Posterolateral to the main lobe is a smaller lobe of elongate, poorly defined shape. The two outer lobes just barely meet each other opposite midlength of the main lobe.^nThe three lobes in the L1 area of Ceratocephala exigua are strikingly similar to the lobes of the subdivided L1 in selenopeltines. It appears reasonable to assume that these structures in C. exigua are homologous to L1a, L1b, and L1c in other odontopleurids.^nThe clearest lobation in the L1 area in species of Ceratocephala is present in Upper Ordovician C. laticapitata Warburg, 1925. This species was refigured by Bruton (1966b; pi. 4, figs 5-8), and although he apparently included^nat least two lobes (L1b and L1c) in his concept of LI, he did not comment on the subdivision of the lobe. Newly collected material of C. laticapitata is illustrated here (Fig. 7d-g). In C. laticapitata the axial furrow can be traced posterolaterally from along L2 in a course well outside the conventional ''LI'', describing a large curve around this, and posteriorly running adaxially to meet the anterolateral corner of the occipital ring. That this furrow really is the axial furrow is indicated by the presence of the A 1 - A 2 - A 3 row immediately adjacent to it (the same position as in C.exigua), and by other morphologic details (see below). The area thus enclosed is very large, and composed of three sublobes. The adaxial, main lobe is well defined and it is this lobe that has been conventionally interpreted as constituting L1 in Ceratocephala. However, two outer lobes are also well defined. The anterolateral of these is rounded elongate and about half the size of the main lobe. The transverse furrow separating the anterolateral lobe from the posterolateral lobe is distinct. The axial furrow along the posterolateral lobe is distinct along its entire course (Fig. 7d-g; Bruton 1966b; pi. 4, fig. 6). A second indication for the above interpretation is that the surface texture differs markedly on each side of the proposed axial furrow. The entire fixed cheek is densely pitted, whereas the lobes are smooth (Fig. 7e). The pitted area ends abruptly against the proposed axial furrow. This is so on external and internal moulds alike. A third indication is that the lateral margin of the occipital ring is directed obliquely anterolaterally, in a direction continued by the axial furrow. If only the adaxial lobe of L1 constituted the basal lobe, then the axial furrow would be the furrow ending posteriorly against the occipital ring far from its lateral margin. The glabella would be considerably narrower across L1 than the width (tr.) of the occipital ring. A local, lateral expansion (compared to other odontopleurids) must in that case be assumed for the occipital ring and the field of the fixed cheek. Such a local expansion and the resultant aberrant course of the axial furrow is a much less parsimonious explanation than one arguing that the extreme lateral expansion of the cranidium is produced by a lateral expansion of the glabella, involving the entire glabella and occipital ring and being evenly distributed. The fourth and most important indication that L1 is composed of three sublobes in the above species is given by the course of SI. This furrow continues abaxially well past the anterolateral corner of the inner L1 lobe. If the furrow laterally bounding this inner lobe is the axial furrow, then SI crosses the axial furrow. SI does not cross the axial furrow in any other odontopleurid, nor in any other trilobite that I know of. The definition of the lateral glabellar furrows is that they are positioned on the glabella, and the glabella is defined laterally by the axial furrow. Therefore, SI does not and cannot cross the axial furrow. It can be concluded that the axial furrow in Ceratocephala is the abaxially located furrow described above, from the combined evidence of:^n(1) The position relative to the A1-A2-A3 line, being set close to it.^n(2) The different surface texture on each side of the furrow. (3) The position and angle laterally of the occipital ring.^n(4) The course of SI.^nFrom this follows that the three lobes inCeratocephala discussed above are all part of L1 and are likely to be homologous with L1a, L1b and L1c in other odontopleurids.^nIn Lower Silurian species of Ceratocephala these lobes may still be discernible, as in C. avalanchensis Chatterton and Perry (1983; pi. 31, fig. 7), or even distinct, as in the cephalon of another Ceratocephala of Chatterton and Perry (1983; pi. 33, fig. 11). In later Silurian and Devonian Ceratocephala the tripartite division of L1 is usually not noticeable, since only L1b is defined by furrows, and the more laterally set L1a and L1c have merged completely with the fixed cheek.^nThe ontogeny of Ceratocephala can now be reconsidered in the light of this conclusion. The ontogeny of various Ceratocephala is well known, and additional material is illustrated here in Figure 2 (photographs kindly supplied by B. D. E. Chatterton). However, it sheds little additional light on the origin of the subdivision of L1. In the Middle Ordovician C. laciniata Whittington and Evitt, 1954 the subdivision is present, though not very distinct, throughout the holaspid period and in at least the later part of the meraspid period (see also Hu 1974). In earlier meraspid stages of C. triacantheis (Fig. 2b, c; Chatterton 1980; pi. 19) the axial furrows are essentially undefined. The small basal glabellar lateral lobe present occupies only a minor part of the area between the longitudinal furrow and the A1-A2-A3 line. The area between this basal lobe and the A1-A2-A3 line may equally well be cheek area as it may be glabellar area, since the absence of a defined axial furrow makes it impossible to determine which is correct. In photographs showing an early ontogenetic series of Silurian Ceratocephala (kindly supplied by B. D. E. Chatterton), some of which are published here in Figure 2, the development is slightly clearer. In cephala with a sagittal length of 0-38 mm there is a small basal lobe similar to that in early C. triacantheis. On the adaxial edge of this lobe are two spinose tubercles, set on an exsagittal line. These tubercles can be followed through the ontogenetic series (Fig. 2m), and are always in this abaxial position on the lobe. In a cephalon with a sagittal length of 0-76 mm (Fig. 2n) the axial furrow has appeared and is shallow but identifiable along its entire course. Adaxial to it a distinct L1a is defined and a slightly less well-defined L1c is present. The small basal lobe which was present in the smallest meraspis is revealed by its pair of tubercles as L1b, and it^nfollows that the undifferentiated area lateral to the lobe in early stages includes L1a and L1c.^nIn summary, the sublobation in adult Ceratocephala has been carried to an extreme, with L1a and L1c being nearly as large as L1b, though they are usually completely merged with the fixed cheek, and only L1b is defined.^nOutgroup comparison. A sublobation of L1 is present to some extent also in the three other odontopleurid subfamilies. In the Acidaspidinae it was first noted by Whittard (1961) in Primaspis (now Meadowtownella) whitei, in which L1c is distinctly defined by a transverse furrow across L1 . A similar furrow was noted by Bruton in Estonian Upper Ordovician Acidaspis aviensis Bruton, 1968b, and Ross (1979) noted its presence in two Acidaspis species from the Ordovician of Kentucky. Still stronger is the division of L1 in Swedish Lower Wenlock Dudleyaspis (Dudleyaspis) uncifera Ramskold, 1984 in which the presence of a curved dividing furrow (now recognised to be between L1b and L1c) was included in the diagnosis.^nIn the Odontopleurinae the furrow is clear in Odontopleura ovata. Siveter (1989) discussed the feature in this and other species, regarding it as an atavism due to its presence in the Cambrian Acidaspides precurrens (material previously assigned to this species is revised here in the Systematic palaeontology section).^nIn the Apianurinae the furrow directed posterolaterally from the SI apodemal pit is the furrow separating L1c from Lib, and not, as previously thought, SI. This is best seen in Apianurus narrawayi Raymond, 1910 in which SI and the dividing furrow are both distinct (Shaw 1968; pi. 10, fig. 29).^nOntogeny. See under point 3.3 above. In addition, it may be noted that in meraspides of Selenopeltis the subdivision is weaker than in adults. Polarity. The strength of the glabellar furrows increases during ontogeny. It is not possible to determine the presence of sublobe-defining furrows in early ontogenetic stages. Outgroup evidence indicates that presence or sublobation may be primitive. However, since the ontogenetic evidence is inconclusive, no polarity is given here for this feature, and it is coded as missing data for the hypanc.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='There is not a presence/absence condition for L3, contrary to the opinion of many writers. There is a difference in expression of L3 depending on the depth of S2 and, in particular, of S3. S2 and S.3 are the dorsal expressions of the apodemes for appendage musculature of the third and fourth pair of cephalic appendages, counted from posterior. It is more reasonable to assume that the size and musculature of these appendages varied than it is to assume that appendages come and go in different species within genera and in different individuals within species (compare with Sdzuy''s (1979, p. 68) rejection of ''jumping'' of function between these furrows). It is common that S3 is distinct on the ventral side but indistinguishable on the dorsal. From this it follows there may be a continuous range between the extremities and the condition of L3 cannot be coded as present/absent. There is, however, a natural discontinuity in the range of expression of S3 and this has been used here as a state-defining discontinuity. The distinctness of L3 is a feature almost entirely secondary to the strength of S3.^nOntogeny. The S0-S3 ''furrows'' (apodemal pits) are equally distinct in early meraspid stages (indicating about equally sized appendage pairs). In later meraspid stages and in holaspides, S3 becomes relatively smaller and shallower (suggesting a differentiation, in size at least, of the cephalic appendages).^nPolarity. Well-defined L3 is regarded as primitive (state 0).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='These tubercles were recognised by Whittington (1956a) as consistently present in early ontogenetic stages of odontopleurids. Sometimes they are retained also in holaspides as tubercles considerably larger than other tubercles on the fixed cheek.^nOntogeny. The ontogeny of these tubercles was described by Whittington (1956a), and are further commented on herein under Section 3.3.^nPolarity. Presence of large Al, A2, and A3 is regarded as primitive (state 1).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='The posterior border usually continues laterally unbroken, crossing the facial suture, onto the free cheek. In some taxa with very anteriorly set eyes, the posterior border furrow curves anteriorly abaxially near the suture and runs anteriorly parallel to a strong sutural ridge to merge with the palpebral furrow.^nOntogeny. This furrow is not clear in early meraspides; when it appears in later meraspid stages, it has the course of the adult stage.^nPolarity. Outgroup evidence indicates that anteriorly set eyes and a strong sutural ridge are parts of a derived character complex. A lateral border furrow continuing onto the free cheek is tentatively regarded as primitive (state 0).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=7 TEXT='A median occipital structure is usually present in odontopleurids, ranging in size from a long spine to a weak tubercle. The condition for adult holaspides is coded here. A tall tubercle is not regarded as a spine.^nOntogeny. A prominent median occipital tubercle or spine is present in all odontopleurids from protaspid stages onward. Its size usually decreases during ontogeny but in some genera a prominent median spine is present in adults.^nPolarity. Outgroup evidence indicates the median occipital tubercle in early ontogenetic stages is a larval feature that may be transformed into a spine in later stages. Although originating from the same position, the larval tubercle and the adult spine are not comparable and at least sometimes (e.g., in Acidaspis) not homologous. This uncertainty makes a polarity determination for this feature ambiguous and it is therefore not made here.';

The ontogeny is poorly known for taxa lacking paired occipital spines, but Selenopeltis meraspides of degree 6 lack paired occipital spines.

	TEXT CHARACTER=11 TEXT='A common view regarding selenopeltine trilobites has been that the genal spine arises from the cheek area, and not from the border (e.g. Reed 1925b; Gill 1947; Prantl & Pfibyl 1949). This interpretation has been used in the diagnoses of various selenopeltines at generic, subfamilial and familial levels alike (e.g. Prantl & Pfibyl 1949; Bruton^n1968a; Bruton in Bruton & Henry 1978; Campbell 1977). However, Whittington and Evitt (1954, p. 52) showed for Ceratocephala that this was not correct. Whittington (1956a, p. 170) noted the correct origin of the spine and stated that ''the fact that the doublure extends beneath the base of the genal spine shows that the spine arises from the border and not the surface of the cheek''. Campbell (1977, p. 126) added further evidence when he noted for Dicranurus that the ''posterior border furrow is continuous on to the edge of the free cheek, demonstrating that the border in this region is subsumed into the base of the genal spine''.^nAs is argued below, the genal spine has attained its ''supramarginal'' position through the development of an additional furrow (termed the epiborder furrow below) beside the lateral border furrow, and through a considerable modification of the lateral border, which has been partly incorporated into a composite field of the cheek.^nCommon to all selenopeltine trilobites is the development of an epiborder furrow (defined below). Such a furrow is otherwise absent in odontopleurids. In most selenopeltine genera the true lateral border furrow is nearly or completely effaced. It is possible to follow the successive morphological stages in the restructuring of the lateral cephalic border from a narrow, convex border with a ''normal'' border furrow to the extreme condition in Laethoprusia. It should be noted that these stages are morphotypic stages rather than developmental or phylogenetic sequences, although they may to some extent reflect the phytogeny of the group. It has not been possible to use the width of the cheek doublure in this analysis, since it is known in too few genera. It seems, however, that the doublure generally ends under the deepest border furrow.^nCeratocephala. Within the Selenopeltinae and Ceratocephalinae the lateral cephalic border in Ceratocephala is the least derived (as determined from ontogeny and outgroup evidence). Stratigraphically young species differ little from the earliest representatives. A representative example is the free cheek of C. laciniata Whittington and Evitt, 1954, pi. 6, fig. 7 (Fig. 4a). The base of the genal spine forks into three ridges, one narrow continuing into the sutural ridge, one wide fading into the field of cheek and the third forming the lateral border. There are two rows of spines on the anterior two-thirds of the lateral border. The outer, more ventral of these are the border spines. These are shown by the ontogeny to be homologous with the border spines in other odontopleurids. Inside, and parallel to this row is a second row of slightly smaller and more irregularly set spines. These are here termed the epiborder spines. Presumably homologous epiborder spines are present in most odontopleurids. In juvenile Ceratocephala the epiborder spines are much larger and more widely spaced than the border spines (Fig. 2o), showing the primitive condition for these spines. Between the two rows of spines the border forms a narrow band that is flat in cross-section. The posterior third of the border is more modified, being convex only along the field of the cheek, while the outer part forms a transversely concave flange to the base of the genal angle. The border furrow is distinct along the entire border.^nCeratocara. Having identified these structures in Ceratocephala, there are no problems in recognising the homologous structures in the next morphological stage, represented by Ceratocara gen. nov. A well-preserved cheek of C. rarspina was figured by Whittington (1956a; pi. 15, fig. 29) (Fig. 4b). The border spines are separated from the epiborder spines by a deep furrow running the full length of the border. This furrow is the equivalent of the flat band between the border and epiborder spines merging with the posterolateral concave area in Ceratocephala. It is here termed the epiborder furrow. The true border furrow is still distinct along the entire border. The two parallel bands constituting the border (correctly identified by Whittington 1956a, p. 242) are here called the exterior border and the interior border.^nCeratocephalina. The next morphological stage is seen in the free cheek of Ceratocephalina tridens, as figured by Whittington (1956a; pi. 16, fig. 23) (Fig. 4c). The epiborder furrow and the border furrow are both distinct and continue anteriorly adjacent to the facial suture. The exterior border is expanded in width, particularly posteriorly. The epiborder furrow becomes very deep near the posterolateral cheek margin and is there overhung by the base of the genal spine, giving the familiar ''supramarginal'' impression of this spine. In later species of Ceratocephalina, best seen in C. sevastopuloi Chatterton and Perry (1983, pi. 36), the widening of the posterior part of the exterior border has progressed further, and the border spines are reduced in size. The epiborder spines are still present. In addition a new row of spines has developed on the exterior border parallel to the border spines. These spines are here termed the secondary epiborder spines. Ceratonurus. The following stage is seen in Ceratonurus, as illustrated by Campbell (1977; pi. 37, fig. 1). The border furrow is present posteriorly only. The interior border is thus short, and constitutes what is the ''swollen base of the genal spine'' in the usual terminology of selenopeltines. The epiborder furrow is wide and runs along the entire margin, outlining a wide exterior border, convex in cross-section. The border spines are long. The secondary epiborder spines are strong. Approximately the same stage has been reached by Miraspis (Fig. 4d) and possibly by Proceratocephala (Fig. 7a, c). The cheek of Selenopeltoides is not well known (Fig. 10c), but apart from lacking border spines seems to be at about this stage, or possibly the next.^nDicranurus. The following stage is seen in Dicranurus, e.g. in the cheek of D. monstrosus illustrated by Bruton (1968a; pi. 10, fig. 10), or Dicranurus sp. nov. (Figs 4e and 5). The border furrow is present only as a faint concavity along the anterior part of the base of the genal spine, merging anteriorly with the epiborder furrow and outlining a short inflated interior border. The epiborder furrow is distinct and outlines a wide, horizontally flat exterior border. Border spines and epiborder spines are lost and only small tubercles remain of the secondary epiborder spines. In Dicranurus sp. nov. (Ramskold & Holloway, in prep.; Fig. 5 herein) the border furrow and secondary epiborder spines are a little more distinct than in other species, and on internal moulds (Fig. 5b) a row of tiny, marginal protuberances are the reduced remains of the cheek border spines. An approximately equivalent stage has been reached by Selenopeltis (Fig. 4f).^nIsoprusia. The next stage is represented by Isoprusia. I. mydlakia Bruton (1966a; pi. 55, fig. 14) (Fig. 4g), there are faint traces only of what appears to be the border furrow along the base of the genal spine. The epiborder furrow is very wide and the exterior border is flattened and almost horizontal. The epiborder furrow does not reach the posterior margin and there is a smooth transition from genal spine to exterior border. There are a few tiny border spines on the posterior part of the cheek. Epiborder spines and secondary epiborder spines are lost. Laethoprusia. The final stage is seen in Laethoprusk salax (Fig. 4). In adults there is no trace of the border furrow, epiborder spines, or secondary epiborder spines. The border spines can be identified as a row of slightly more prominent tubercles. The interior border (''swollen base of^nthe genal spine'') characteristic of all stages described so far but the first has disappeared, and the epiborder furrow curves up along the posterior margin, passes the base of the genal spine, and merges adaxially with the posterior border furrow. The exterior border, outlined by the epiborder furrow, is rounded in section and not particularly wide.^nDiscussion. A full morphological circle has nearly been completed, and in Laethoprusia there is a genal spine seemingly merging with a narrow border defined by lateral and posterior border furrows. It much resembles the free cheeks of odontopleurines and acidaspidines. However, in Laethoprusia the lateral border furrow is in fact the epiborder furrow and a portion of the field of the free cheek is a modified part (the interior border) of what was at some earlier stage the lateral border (see ''Note added in proof).^nThe development of the border is coupled with variation in the width of the doublure. As the width of the border (interior and exterior) increases, so does the width of the doublure. It is common knowledge that in a large number of trilobites the doublure reaches approximately to the border furrow. This is interpreted as functional and the border and doublure together form a more or less tubular strengthening device around the cephalon. In some selenopeltines the widening of the exterior border is coupled with a loss of the border spines, as in Dicranurus and Selenopeltis, whereas in others the border spines may be retained on a very wide exterior border (Proceratocephala; Fig. 7a, c) or lost on a narrow exterior border (Laethoprusia and Selenopeltoides). Campbell''s (1977, p. 118) suggestion that the border spines are lost by a progressive fusion of their bases does thus not seem correct. Reduction and loss of border spines on the cheek is more strongly correlated with the general loss of secondary spines in the entire exoskeleton than with the width of the exterior border, which is a more variable feature and shows a considerable independence from the degree of spinosity.^nOntogeny. The detailed ontogeny of these furrows is not known. It is clear, however, that the rows of border and epiborder spines are present and distinct already in meraspid stages, e.g., in Ceratocephala (Fig. 2m, o), and since the position of the (incipient) furrows is correlated to these rows, the position of the furrows appears not to change noticeably during these and later ontogenetic stages.^nPolarity. Outgroup evidence indicates that fully separate border and epiborder furrows are primitive (state 0).';

Little is known from the early stages of the free cheek after the facial suture has shifted to a position abaxial to the genal spine, thereby transferring the spine to the free cheek. In meraspid (early holaspid?) cheeks of Ceratocephala the base of the genal spine appears to be confluent with the lateral border (Whittington & Evitt 1954; pi. 25, fig. 19).^nPolarity. A base of the genal spine confluent with the borders is regarded as primitive (state 0).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=14 TEXT='In all selenopeltines with known thorax the segments are of unequal length (sag., exsag.) within the thorax. The segments become progressively longer posteriorly, reach maximum length around the fourth segment, whereupon the length decreases rapidly in the most posterior segments. This circumstance has very rarely been noted in the descriptions (but see Prantl & Pribyl 1949, p. 174), and has only recently been briefly discussed for one genus, Selenopeltis, by Hammann et al. (1986) and Hammann and Rabano (1987). It is demonstrated below that the differentiated lengths of the thoracic segments in the Selenopeltinae follow a regular pattern, which can be described mathematically, and the strong differentiation is regarded as an important synapomorphy for the subfamily.^nComplete articulated thoraces are known for the following selenopeltine genera: Ceratonurus, Dicranurus, Miraspis, Proceratocephala, Selenopeltis, and Selenopeltoides. It is not clear from Novak''s (1883) drawing of the articulated Koneprusia fuscina specimen whether or not the thoracic segments have differentiated lengths, but the hypothesis proposed here of such a condition in all selenopeltines postulates that there is such a differentiation. However, if Koneprusia and allies (Isoprusia and Laethoprusia) are the most primitive selenopeltines, which is unlikely but cannot be excluded on the basis of the cladistic analysis herein, then they (and perhaps Ceratocephalina as well) may have retained the plesiomorphic condition of undifferentiated segmental lengths in the thorax. Alternatively, if the segmental lengths are undifferentiated in Koneprusia only, this condition is an autapomorphy for the genus (see ''Note added in proof).^nMeasurements of several specimens of the same species been possible in one selenopeltine species only, Miraspis mira. The plot of these measurements of five specimens (Fig. 8a) shows that there is little or no intraspecific variation in this feature, since the differences are within the error of measurement. Similarly, the two specimens of a Ceratonurus species yield near identical plots (Fig. 8d). On the assumption that this lack of intraspecific variation applies also to other selenopeltines, differences between plots of various taxa represented by single specimens are taken as real.^nOn the next taxonomic level, the available evidence indicates little intrageneric variation. In Selenopeltis, five specimens of three different species have been measured, and their data are in nearly perfect accord (Fig. 8b). The two Dicranurus specimens, of different species, show the same strong correlation (Fig. 8c).^nIt is possible that the differentiated length of segments within the thorax has developed for functional reasons and is correlated with the pattern of enrollment. It is also possible that this is a condition secondary to the size of the posterior pleural spines, either as a pleiotropic effect or for reasons of mechanical strength. A functional analysis of the enrollment patterns in selenopeltines (see Hammann et al. 1986 and Hammann & Rabano 1987 for functional studies of Selenopeltis) is very interesting but beyond the scope of this paper. The review below is restricted to morphological aspects of the differentiated segmental lengths. The segmental lengths are given as percentages of the total thoracic length between anterior and posterior articulating edges. 1. Miraspis. The segmental lenghts are distributed in the thorax in almost perfect accord (r = 0"?99) with a curve of a quadratic equation, y = 10.4 + 1.47x -0.21x^2^nMaximum length (13%) is reached at the fourth segment. The two most posterior segments are very short, and there is a weak tendency for the last (ninth) to be slightly longer than the predicted length according to the curve. This tendency is present in some other selenopeltines as well (Dicranurus, Proceratocephala) and may indicate a lower, perhaps functional, limit to the smallest length of a segment. The (unquantified) correlation between segment length and posterior pleural spine size is relatively good, though the largest spines are on segments four to six, i.e. slightly posterior to maximum segmental length.^n2. Ceratonurus.The first segment is short (10% of thoracic length), while segments three to six are the longest (around 13%), perhaps with a maximum at the third segment (Fig. 8d). The posterior segments decrease rapidly in length, at a rate very similar to that of Miraspis mira. The correlation between segmental length and spine size is strong.^n3. Proceratocephala. The relative segmental lengths in P. terribilis (Fig. 8d) are virtually identical to those of Miraspis. This is not in accord with the sizes of the posterior pleural spines since, except for the smaller spine on the first segment, these are of similar size throughout the thorax (Fig. 7a).^n4. Selenopeltoides. The segmental length differentiation in S. barbarus (Fig. 8d) is very similar to that of Miraspis mira. The correlation between segmental length and spine size is fairly weak, and maximum spine size is reached at the eighth segment (Fig. 10a).^n5. Selenopeltis. There is extremely good correlation of the relative segmental lengths between the thoraces of all Selenopeltis species and specimens measured here (Fig. 8b). The first segment is short (8-10%), length increases rapidly to reach maximum (about 14%) in the third and fourth segments; length then decreases progressively to the very short (about 6%) ninth segment. The correlation to the best-fit curve of a quadratic equation is very good, r = 0.96. Correlation with spine size is relatively weak, since the posterior pleural spines are large throughout the thorax except in the eighth and ninth segments, and sometimes also in the first segment.^n6. Dicranurus. Segmental length is small anteriorly (9%), then increases rapidly to reach maximum length on fourth and sixth segments (13-14%), while the fifth is shorter (12-13%) (Fig. 8c). The length decreases much posterior to the sixth segment, though the ninth segment is not quite as short as in most other selenopeltines (8% versus 6-7%). The small length of the fifth segment is correlated with the almost completely reduced posterior pleural spine in this segment (Fig. 9), an autapomorphy for Dicranurus. The diminutive posterior pleural spine of the fifth segment in Dicranurus is present in all species with known thorax (D. hamatus elegantus Campbell, 1977; pi. 36, fig. 1; D. kinglakensis of Fig. 9; D. longispinis of Etheridge & Mitchell 1897; pi. 54, fig. 1 - specimen examined; D. monstrosus of Bruton 1968a; pi. 10, fig. 1; D. sp. nov. of Figure 5). Segmental length is otherwise well correlated with spine size.^n7. Ceratocephala. Only one specimen has been measured (Fig. 8f). This shows there is no differentiation within the thorax anterior to the tenth segment. It is argued above (Section 3.1) that this segment is homologous with the first pygidial segment in selenopeltines, and it can thus be expected to differ from the more anterior segments. The small length of the tenth segment in Ceratocephala is accordingly not regarded as a feature homologous with the length differentiation present in selenopeltines.^nOutgroup comparison. Strongly differentiated lengths of segments within the thorax is a feature not unusual in trilobites, though within the Odontopleuridae the phenomenon is particularly well seen in the Selenopeltinae. In some other odontopleurids, in particular in a group within the Odontopleurinae (consisting of, i.a., Diacanthaspis, Acanthalomina and Radiaspis), there is also a differentiation, though weaker and of a different kind. A review of the conditions in the three remaining odontopleurid subfamilies follows below.^n1. Odontopleurinae. Articulated specimens are known of three species assigned to Diacanthaspis, D. morenaica Hammann, 1976, D. trippi Harper and Owen, 1986 and D. decacantha(Angelin, 1854). The latter two species do, however, possess a number of major autapomorphies and are not particularly similar to, or representative of, the remaining species of Diacanthaspis, including the type species D. trippi lacks some of the important synapomorphies of Diacanthaspis, such as ''supramarginal'', reduced, true major border spines, and it may at most be a sister taxon to the genus. In addition D. trippi has some important autapomorphies, such as loss of eyes and facial sutures. Segmental length values (Fig. 8e) cannot automatically be taken as representative of Diacanthaspis. Be this as it may, the thoracic segments of D. trippi show little variation in length, with a slight increase posteriorly towards a maximum at the sixth segment, followed by a very slight decrease in length. This differentiation is similar to that in D. morenaica, where segmental lengths increase from 9-1% in the first segment to a maximum of 12-4% in the sixth, followed by a decrease to 10-2% in the ninth. There is thus a segmental length differentiation in Diacanthaspis, but it differs from that of selenopeltines in being less pronounced and in that the maximum length is reached in the posterior, rather than the anterior part of the thorax.^nThe few known articulated Radiaspis specimens (including Xanionurus) are poorly preserved and cannot be accurately measured but appear to have segments of approximately equal length throughout the thorax (Bruton 1968a; pi. 6, figs. 10 and 12). In the remaining genus (or subgenus) of the odontopleurine subgroup discussed here, Acanthalomina, there are fortunately some species in which the thorax is known. Data from A. minuta are presented here (Fig. 8e). Although the material of this species is not ideally preserved, it shows that the two anterior segments are short and the segments become progressively longer posteriorly in the thorax to reach their maximum length far posteriorly (at the eighth segment). When this distribution is compared with the strength and length of the posterior pleural spines, we find an almost perfect correlation between these two parameters. The larger the spine, the longer the segment. Although not analysed in detailed here, it seems the length of the segments is secondary to the strength of the spines. Large spines may either require long (and strong) segments simply for reasons of mechanical strength, or maybe the different segment lengths are a pleiotropic effect, secondary to the size of the spines. This reasoning is consistent with the presence in Dicranurus of the short fifth segment discussed above, carrying only a rudimentary spine.^nIn the odontopleurine Odontopleura (O. prevosti prevosti in the terminology of Snajdr 1984d) (Fig. 8f) the differentiation within the thorax resembles that of Acanthalomina, though it is weaker. The segments become progressively longer posteriorly; there is possibly a maximum at the sixth segment and posterior to this the segments are almost equally long. This condition is approximately paralleled by the progressively stronger pleural spines posteriorly.^n2. Acidaspidinae. In the acidaspidine Anacaenaspis pectinata (Fig. 8f) there is no segmental length differentiation at all (the small differences plotted are within the error of measurement) and the posterior pleural spines increase in size posteriorly by small amounts only.^n3. Apianurinae. In the apianurine Boedaspis (Fig. 8f) the first seven segments are subequally long, except number six, which is slightly longer. This difference is present in both the pleural portion and the axial ring, and is regarded here as real. The lengths of the eighth, ninth and tenth segments are not known. The pleural spines of the sixth segment are not known, so the correlation between spine size and segment length cannot be determined.^nIn a silicified specimen (BMNH It 11507-16) of the apianurine Calipernurus insolitus the two last segments are attached to the pygidium. Both are 0-52 mm in exsagittal length thus there is no segmental length differentiation in the most posterior part of the thorax of Calipernurus.^nConclusions. The outgroup evidence presented above indicates there is a fundamental difference between the segmental length differentiation in the Selenopeltinae and in other odontopleurids. In selenopeltines, maximum length is anteriorly in the thorax, at the third or fourth segment (in Dicranurus at the fourth and sixth). In the odontopleurinae, maximum length (when differentiation is present) is posteriorly situated, in the sixth to eighth segments. Segmental length differentiation is also considerably stronger in the Selenopeltinae, where the shortest segment usually is only 45-55% of the longest, whereas in the measured outgroup taxa it is 65-100%. Available evidence indicates there is little or no differentiation in the Ceratocephalinae, Acidaspidinae and possibly in the Apianurinae.^nThe strongly differentiated segmental lengths, with maximum length reached in the anterior (but not the most anterior) part of thorax, and in particular the much reduced lengths of the posterior segments are aspects of a single character-complex, uniquely derived within the Selenopeltinae.^nComments on the ontogeny of this feature are given under character 15 in the computer analysis (Section 7.5.15). ^nOntogeny. The holaspid stage is defined by this character, and the ontogeny lacks meaning here.^nPolarity. Ontogenetic data cannot be used here, since ontogeny will always polarize fewer thoracic segments as primitive. This cannot possibly be so. However, the analysis in Section 3.4 indicates that the primitive condition for the ingroup taxa is to have nine thoracic segments (state 0).';

A functional analysis of the enrollment patterns in selenopeltines (see Hammann et al. 1986 and Hammann & Rabano 1987 for functional studies of Selenopeltis) is very interesting but beyond the scope of this paper. The review below is restricted to morphological aspects of the differentiated segmental lengths. The segmental lengths are given as percentages of the total thoracic length between anterior and posterior articulating edges. 1. Miraspis. The segmental lenghts are distributed in the thorax in almost perfect accord (r = 0""?99) with a curve of a quadratic equation, y = 10.4 + 1.47x -0.21x^2^nMaximum length (13%) is reached at the fourth segment. The two most posterior segments are very short, and there is a weak tendency for the last (ninth) to be slightly longer than the predicted length according to the curve. This tendency is present in some other selenopeltines as well (Dicranurus, Proceratocephala) and may indicate a lower, perhaps functional, limit to the smallest length of a segment. The (unquantified) correlation between segment length and posterior pleural spine size is relatively good, though the largest spines are on segments four to six, i.e. slightly posterior to maximum segmental length.^n2. Ceratonurus.The first segment is short (10% of thoracic length), while segments three to six are the longest (around 13%), perhaps with a maximum at the third segment (Fig. 8d). The posterior segments decrease rapidly in length, at a rate very similar to that of Miraspis mira. The correlation between segmental length and spine size is strong.^n3. Proceratocephala. The relative segmental lengths in P. terribilis (Fig. 8d) are virtually identical to those of Miraspis. This is not in accord with the sizes of the posterior pleural spines since, except for the smaller spine on the first segment, these are of similar size throughout the thorax (Fig. 7a).^n4. Selenopeltoides. The segmental length differentiation in S. barbarus (Fig. 8d) is very similar to that of Miraspis mira. The correlation between segmental length and spine size is fairly weak, and maximum spine size is reached at the eighth segment (Fig. 10a).^n5. Selenopeltis. There is extremely good correlation of the relative segmental lengths between the thoraces of all Selenopeltis species and specimens measured here (Fig. 8b). The first segment is short (8-10%), length increases rapidly to reach maximum (about 14%) in the third and fourth segments; length then decreases progressively to the very short (about 6%) ninth segment. The correlation to the best-fit curve of a quadratic equation is very good, r = 0.96. Correlation with spine size is relatively weak, since the posterior pleural spines are large throughout the thorax except in the eighth and ninth segments, and sometimes also in the first segment.^n6. Dicranurus. Segmental length is small anteriorly (9%), then increases rapidly to reach maximum length on fourth and sixth segments (13-14%), while the fifth is shorter (12-13%) (Fig. 8c). The length decreases much posterior to the sixth segment, though the ninth segment is not quite as short as in most other selenopeltines (8% versus 6-7%). The small length of the fifth segment is correlated with the almost completely reduced posterior pleural spine in this segment (Fig. 9), an autapomorphy for Dicranurus. The diminutive posterior pleural spine of the fifth segment in Dicranurus is present in all species with known thorax (D. hamatus elegantus Campbell, 1977; pi. 36, fig. 1; D. kinglakensis of Fig. 9; D. longispinis of Etheridge & Mitchell 1897; pi. 54, fig. 1 - specimen examined; D. monstrosus of Bruton 1968a; pi. 10, fig. 1; D. sp. nov. of Figure 5). Segmental length is otherwise well correlated with spine size.^n7. Ceratocephala. Only one specimen has been measured (Fig. 8f). This shows there is no differentiation within the thorax anterior to the tenth segment. It is argued above (Section 3.1) that this segment is homologous with the first pygidial segment in selenopeltines, and it can thus be expected to differ from the more anterior segments. The small length of the tenth segment in Ceratocephala is accordingly not regarded as a feature homologous with the length differentiation present in selenopeltines.^nOutgroup comparison. Strongly differentiated lengths of segments within the thorax is a feature not unusual in trilobites, though within the Odontopleuridae the phenomenon is particularly well seen in the Selenopeltinae. In some other odontopleurids, in particular in a group within the Odontopleurinae (consisting of, i.a., Diacanthaspis, Acanthalomina and Radiaspis), there is also a differentiation, though weaker and of a different kind. A review of the conditions in the three remaining odontopleurid subfamilies follows below.^n1. Odontopleurinae. Articulated specimens are known of three species assigned to Diacanthaspis, D. morenaica Hammann, 1976, D. trippi Harper and Owen, 1986 and D. decacantha(Angelin, 1854). The latter two species do, however, possess a number of major autapomorphies and are not particularly similar to, or representative of, the remaining species of Diacanthaspis, including the type species D. trippi lacks some of the important synapomorphies of Diacanthaspis, such as ''supramarginal'', reduced, true major border spines, and it may at most be a sister taxon to the genus. In addition D. trippi has some important autapomorphies, such as loss of eyes and facial sutures. Segmental length values (Fig. 8e) cannot automatically be taken as representative of Diacanthaspis. Be this as it may, the thoracic segments of D. trippi show little variation in length, with a slight increase posteriorly towards a maximum at the sixth segment, followed by a very slight decrease in length. This differentiation is similar to that in D. morenaica, where segmental lengths increase from 9-1% in the first segment to a maximum of 12-4% in the sixth, followed by a decrease to 10-2% in the ninth. There is thus a segmental length differentiation in Diacanthaspis, but it differs from that of selenopeltines in being less pronounced and in that the maximum length is reached in the posterior, rather than the anterior part of the thorax.^nThe few known articulated Radiaspis specimens (including Xanionurus) are poorly preserved and cannot be accurately measured but appear to have segments of approximately equal length throughout the thorax (Bruton 1968a; pi. 6, figs. 10 and 12). In the remaining genus (or subgenus) of the odontopleurine subgroup discussed here, Acanthalomina, there are fortunately some species in which the thorax is known. Data from A. minuta are presented here (Fig. 8e). Although the material of this species is not ideally preserved, it shows that the two anterior segments are short and the segments become progressively longer posteriorly in the thorax to reach their maximum length far posteriorly (at the eighth segment). When this distribution is compared with the strength and length of the posterior pleural spines, we find an almost perfect correlation between these two parameters. The larger the spine, the longer the segment. Although not analysed in detailed here, it seems the length of the segments is secondary to the strength of the spines. Large spines may either require long (and strong) segments simply for reasons of mechanical strength, or maybe the different segment lengths are a pleiotropic effect, secondary to the size of the spines. This reasoning is consistent with the presence in Dicranurus of the short fifth segment discussed above, carrying only a rudimentary spine.^nIn the odontopleurine Odontopleura (O. prevosti prevosti in the terminology of Snajdr 1984d) (Fig. 8f) the differentiation within the thorax resembles that of Acanthalomina, though it is weaker. The segments become progressively longer posteriorly; there is possibly a maximum at the sixth segment and posterior to this the segments are almost equally long. This condition is approximately paralleled by the progressively stronger pleural spines posteriorly.^n2. Acidaspidinae. In the acidaspidine Anacaenaspis pectinata (Fig. 8f) there is no segmental length differentiation at all (the small differences plotted are within the error of measurement) and the posterior pleural spines increase in size posteriorly by small amounts only.^n3. Apianurinae. In the apianurine Boedaspis (Fig. 8f) the first seven segments are subequally long, except number six, which is slightly longer. This difference is present in both the pleural portion and the axial ring, and is regarded here as real. The lengths of the eighth, ninth and tenth segments are not known. The pleural spines of the sixth segment are not known, so the correlation between spine size and segment length cannot be determined.^nIn a silicified specimen (BMNH It 11507-16) of the apianurine Calipernurus insolitus the two last segments are attached to the pygidium. Both are 0-52 mm in exsagittal length thus there is no segmental length differentiation in the most posterior part of the thorax of Calipernurus.^nConclusions. The outgroup evidence presented above indicates there is a fundamental difference between the segmental length differentiation in the Selenopeltinae and in other odontopleurids. In selenopeltines, maximum length is anteriorly in the thorax, at the third or fourth segment (in Dicranurus at the fourth and sixth). In the odontopleurinae, maximum length (when differentiation is present) is posteriorly situated, in the sixth to eighth segments. Segmental length differentiation is also considerably stronger in the Selenopeltinae, where the shortest segment usually is only 45-55% of the longest, whereas in the measured outgroup taxa it is 65-100%. Available evidence indicates there is little or no differentiation in the Ceratocephalinae, Acidaspidinae and possibly in the Apianurinae.^nThe strongly differentiated segmental lengths, with maximum length reached in the anterior (but not the most anterior) part of thorax, and in particular the much reduced lengths of the posterior segments are aspects of a single character-complex, uniquely derived within the Selenopeltinae.^nComments on the ontogeny of this feature are given under character 15 in the computer analysis (Section 7.5.15). ^nOntogeny. The ontogeny of this character can be determined only from articulated meraspides. The only usable illustrations of specimens of that kind known are the Selenopeltis specimens figured by Snajdr (1984a). There is certainly a length differentiation in the degree six meraspides figured, the sixth segment being the shortest. This differentiation is intimately coupled with the process of releasing new segments from the transitory pygidium, and the last released is by necessity smaller than the ones anteriorly. It appears likely that the differentiation in the meraspide is not homologous with the differentiation in adults. This conclusion is supported by the fact that in Kettneraspis, an odontopleurine lacking length differentiation in adults, a silicified articulated meraspis of degree four (figured by Ramskold & Chatterton, in press) shows the same segmental length differentiation, with segments getting shorter posteriorly. Outgroup evidence indicates that absence of length differentiation in the thorax is primitive.^nPolarity. Absence of length differentiation is regarded as primitive (state 2).';

	TEXT CHARACTER=21 TEXT='By tradition the largest marginal spines in the pygidium of an odontopleurid are referred to as the major, or principal, pygidial spines. It is argued below that these spines are, in some instances, not homologous and also that there is a homologous ''true major border spine structure'' which is the posterior pleural spine of the first pygidial segment. This spine may range in size from a tiny tubercle to the largest spine in the trilobite, and in position from marginal or supramarginal on the pygidium to on the most posterior thoracic segment. In the Selenopeltinae, Ceratocephalinae, and Odontopleurinae it is the posterior pleural spine of the tenth postcephalic segment, while in the Apianurinae and Acidaspidinae it is the serially homologous spine of the eleventh postcephalic segment. This analysis (see below) is of paramount importance, since it makes it possible to follow and understand the development of the various types of pygidia in the family and it also suggests why Ceratocephala, for example, has 10 thoracic segments and not nine, why Calipernurus and Apianurus should have the same number of thoracic segments and why structures in the pygidia of Proceratocephala and Ceratocephala. which look superficially similar, may have completely different origins.^nOrigin of the true major border spines. As in most trilobites, the pygidium of odontopleurid trilobites is composed of several ''fused'' (or, rather, unreleased) segments. The most anterior (first) of these is usually readily identifiable, while the ones situated posteriorly to the first are increasingly modified. In the Selenopeltinae and Odontopleurinae (taxa with nine thoracic segments) the first pygidial segment is the tenth postcephalic segment. The first pygidial segment is commonly similar to the posterior thoracic segments, and Whittington (1956a) recognised the serial homology of these structures. Several structures serially homologous with those of the thoracic segments can be identified in the first pygidial segment (as noted by^nBruton 1965, p. 352), such as the axial ring, pleural ridge and furrow, and anterior (secondary) and posterior (major) pleural spines.^nThe posterior pleural spines of the tenth postcephalic segment in the Selenopeltinae and Odontopleurinae, and of the eleventh segment in the Apianurinae and Acidaspidinae, are here called the ''true major border spines'', and they are indeed often the largest in the pygidium. Anterior and posterior to these are a number of smaller, marginal, ''secondary'' spines, here called the lateral and medial secondary spines, respectively. One or more of the lateral secondary border spines is homologous with the anterior pleural spine/spines in the thoracic segments, though this is rarely obvious. Among selenopeltine genera this is best seen By tradition the largest marginal spines in the pygidium of an odontopleurid are referred to as the major, or principal, pygidial spines. It is argued below that these spines are, in some instances, not homologous and also that there is a homologous ''true major border spine structure'' which is the posterior pleural spine of the first pygidial segment. This spine may range in size from a tiny tubercle to the largest spine in the trilobite, and in position from marginal or supramarginal on the pygidium to on the most posterior thoracic segment. In the Selenopeltinae, Ceratocephalinae, and Odontopleurinae it is the posterior pleural spine of the tenth postcephalic segment, while in the Apianurinae and Acidaspidinae it is the serially homologous spine of the eleventh postcephalic segment. This analysis (see below) is of paramount importance, since it makes it possible to follow and understand the development of the various types of pygidia in the family and it also suggests why Ceratocephala, for example, has 10 thoracic segments and not nine, why Calipernurus and Apianurus should have the same number of thoracic segments and why structures in the pygidia of Proceratocephala and Ceratocephala. which look superficially similar, may have completely different origins.^nOrigin of the true major border spines.

One or more of the lateral secondary border spines is homologous with the anterior pleural spine/spines in the thoracic segments, though this is rarely obvious. Among selenopeltine genera this is best seen in Proceratocephala, where there is a single ventrolaterally directed, short, blunt spine anterolaterally on the pygidium (Fig. 7a). This spine is similar to the short anterior pleural spine of the posteriormost thoracic segment, and is clearly serially homologous with this. Miraspis (Fig. 1) and Ceratonurushave a small number of lateral secondary spines, similar in size and shape to the anterior pleural spine of the posterior thoracic segments. The posteriormost segment in Miraspis mira actually has three small anterior spines, and in the pygidium the number of lateral secondary spines varies between two and four (Snajdr 1988a). In other selenopeltine genera the lateral secondary spines are usually more numerous, and in several genera they are much reduced in size or are completely lost.^nThe number of medial secondary spines varies much in the Selenopeltinae. However, in the other odontopleurid subfamilies it is usually stable, and the identification of the true major border spine in various odontopleurid genera is often dependent on the correct identification of the medial secondary spines. This is discussed in detail below, mainly on the basis of conditions in holaspides.^nTheoretical pygidial spine distribution. As is shown by several features discussed in this paper, it is highly probable that the primitive condition in the odontopleurid pygidium is to possess one anterior (''secondary'', more ventral) and one posterior (''major'', more dorsal) spine per segment, in thorax and pygidium alike. The primitive condition of the pygidium is apparently to be composed of three segments, which decrease in size posteriorly, totalling six spine pairs.^nThe theoretical distribution of these spines would be: a small first (anterior; the lateral secondary spine) followed by a large second (posterior; the true major border spine), a small third (anterior), a medium-sized fourth (posterior), a small fifth (anterior), and a small sixth (posterior). The third segment is by necessity very small and there is never more than one spine pair (the fifth?) developed. Pairs three to five are the three pairs of medial secondary border spines. This theoretical, primitive distribution is rarely obvious in adults, but is present in juveniles of some taxa (best seen in Apianurus).^nThe ''three and one up'' rule. An outgroup, the odontopleurine genus Diacanthaspis, will first be considered. The configuration of the pygidial spines in this genus provides basic information for the understanding of other odontopleurids. The various conditions in the Apianurinae must also be reviewed since they provide clues to the condition in Ceratocephala and Ceratocara.^n1. Diacanthaspis. The following discussion is based entirely on material figured by Whittington (1956a), illustrated schematically here in Fig. 1. Whittington described a number of Diacanthaspis species with varying pygidial morphology. These species, all assumed to possess nine thoracic segments, show all possible intermediate morphological stages from stout, near marginal, true major border spines to a reduction of these spines to tiny tubercles.^nThere are three main criteria for identifying the true major border spine: (1) its position relative to the medial and lateral secondary border spines; (2) it position relative the pleural ridge and (3) its ontogeny. The most primitive (in this particular character) of Whittington''s (1956a) species is Diacanthaspis scitula (Fig. la). There are three pairs of medial secondary spines (in Whittington''s photographs; in the reconstruction in his fig. 8 only two pairs are seen). The largest border spine is stout, with a supramarginal base above the furcation between the third and fourth secondary spine pair (counting laterally from midline), and there are four lateral secondary spine pairs. The largest border spine is connected by a pleural ridge to the first axial ring. We can identify this basic spine pattern with three medial spine pairs followed laterally by a supramarginal ''major'' border spine by counting, from the sagittal line, three marginal spines followed by one that is more dorsally set. This is here called the ''three and one up'' formula. The largest border spine in D. scitula is called the true major border spine.^nUsing the formula in D. cooperi and D. orandensis we find, at ''one up'', the true major border spines easily identifiable, though much reduced in size and set farther from the margin (Fig. lb). The number of lateral secondary spines is here three. Using the formula in D. secreta we cound three medial secondary spines, and at ''one up'' we find a small spine on the pleural ridge (Fig. lc). The ridge is connected to the first axial ring but ends against the border between the third and fourth secondary spine pairs (counted from the posterior). Although Whittington (1956a, fig. 8) reconstructed this spine as the only prominent spine in the pleural area, he did not comment on it in the text. There are three lateral secondary spine pairs also in this species. All lateral and medial secondary spine are subequal in size.^nIn D. lepida (Fig. Id) we find the most lateral pair (the third) of the medial secondary spines to be larger than the other, and at ''one up'' we find, on the pleural ridge, a small vertical spine, only slightly larger than the numerous spines of the surrounding prosopon. There are three pairs of lateral secondary spines. The pleural ridge ends closer (relative to D. secreta) to the base of the most laterally situated of the medial secondary spines. If we had not traced the true major spine through the successive morphological stages described above (not in stratigraphic order, nor to be mistaken for phylogenetic stages), the enlarged secondary spines would be mistaken for the true major border spines. This has indeed always been the case. In D. ulrichi we find the third pair of medial secondary spines still larger (Fig. le), the true major border spine is but a tiny tubercle, and is impossible to identify without the previous information presented here. This type is developed further in odontopleurines like Acanthalomina.^n2. Apianurinae. With this information we now turn to the Apianurinae. In all species of Apianurus the three medial spine pairs are strong and outside of them are generally three or four lateral spines more equally sized. Anteromedially from the furcation between the third and fourth (from the posterior) spine pair, there is a large, vertical spine, connected to the first axial ring by a pleural ridge (see Opik 1937; Whittington 1956a; Bruton 1965, 1966b, 1968b; Shaw 1968; Neben & Krueger 1973; Hu 1974; Chatterton & Ludvigsen 1976; Chatterton 1980). This is the true major pygidial spine, as evidenced by:^n(1) its position relative to the third and fourth pairs of secondary spines.^n(2) its position on the abaxial termination of the pleural ridge.^n(3) its ontogeny, in that in late meraspides and early holaspides it is similar to thoracic posterior pleural spines.^nIt can be concluded that it is the posterior pleural spine homologue of the first pygidial segment and thus homologous (more precisely serially homologous - see below) with the true major border spine in Diacanthaspis.^nIn the apianurine Boedaspis Whittington and Bohlin, 1958 (see also Bruton 1966a, 1968b) there are three medial, marginal spine pairs followed by a large marginal spine connected by a strong pleural ridge to the first axial ring (Fig. 1). There is no spine or large tubercle on the pleural ridge indicating a presence of a reduced, supramarginal border spine. Lateral to the large spine are five or more smaller marginal spines. The large spines are thus apparently the true major border spines.^nThe apianurine Calipernurus Whittington, 1956a has a strongly modified pygidium. My interpretation is that the large pygidial spine pair in Calipernurusis really the true major border spine pair. Supporting evidence comes from the morphology of Apianurus. In Apianurus there are spines, serially homologous with anterior pleural spines in other odontopleurids, developed in the pygidium only. In the last meraspid stage of the Apianurus pygidium there are no anterior pleural spines developed on the unreleased thoracic segment, though the complete number of pygidial secondary border spines is already present (Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 26). In this stage there are four segments, three of which are pygidial. The true major border spine is on the anterior pygidial segment, as are two lateral secondary border spines, one or both of which comprise the (homologue of the) anterior pleural spine of this segment. The most lateral of the three medial spine pairs is smaller than the second and is regarded here as the anterior pleural spine of the second pygidial segment, whereas the second medial secondary spine is regarded as the posterior pleural spine of the same segment. The most posterior spine pair belongs to the third pygidial segment. This interpretation of the medial secondary spine pairs is the same as for other odontopleurids.^nA comparison of the pygidium of Calipernurus with that of Apianurus reveals considerable similarities. There are, as in Apianurus, a few secondary spines anterolateral to the major pair. The configuration of the median border spines also shows similarities to that of Apianurus. There are three medium-sized spines flanked by a smaller pair between the larger ones. This condition much resembles that of late meraspid and early holaspid pygidia of Apianurus (Whittington 1956a; pi. 18, figs 20-24, and pi. 19, fig. 26), the only notable difference being one spine less in Calipernurus. The different sizes of the two outer medial secondary spine pairs in Calipernurus suggest that these, as suggested for Apianurus, are the anterior and posterior pleural spines of the second pygidial segment. In several pygidia of C. insolitus the median spine has a double tip (Whittington 1956a; pi. 24; examined BM material). This indicates that the median spine may be composed of two incompletely fused spines. The secondary spines between the large spine pair in Calipernurus may thus be interpreted as representing three pairs, a smaller outer followed by a medium-sized middle and a fused median pair. If this interpretation is correct, then the plesiomorphic (for odontopleurids) condition of three medial secondary spine pairs is retained, though modified, also in Calipernurus. The incomplete development of the spines of the third segment is paralleled in the poor development of the third axial ring, which is virtually absent.^nA conceivable alternative interpretation of the origin of this pygidium can be hypothesised from the ontogenies of Apianurus barbatus Whittington, 1956a and A. parabarbatus Chatterton and Ludvigsen, 1976, and should be examined. The holaspis-minus-one transitory pygidia of these species (Whittington 1956a, pi. 19, fig. 26; Chatterton 1980, pi. 19, fig. 26) are exceedingly similar to the Calipernurus pygidium. The latter type could perhaps have arisen through the failure in the last meraspid stage to release the last (tenth?) thoracic segment from the pygidium into the thorax, i.e. through a paedomorphic process, such as post-displacement (McNamara 1986). The bases of the broken true major border spines can be seen in the pleural area of the last meraspid stage pygidium of Apianurus. In Calipernurus the pleural area is very small, with no sign of spines (absence confirmed in many specimens examined by me). If the true major spines are situated there, they have been reduced to oblivion. The interpretation of the three medial secondary spine pairs is not affected by this hypothesis.^nThis latter alternative is regarded here as unlikely, for the following reasons. Thoracic segments in both genera, also when unreleased from the transitory pygidium, completely lack anterior pleural spines. The anterior segment in the pygidium of Calipernuruspossesses such spines, and it is therefore unlikely that it is an unreleased thoracic segment. Ir addition, the last meraspid stage pygidium of Apianurus h is four well-defined axial rings. If the pygidium of Calipernurus corresponds to this stage, it would be expected to have more than the two or possibly three rings that are present.^nIt may be concluded that the major spine in the pygidium of Calipernurus is the true major border spine and homologous with that spine in Apianurus. It can therefore be predicted that articulated material, when found, of these genera will show that Apianurus and Calipernurus have the same number of thoracic segments. Whether this means nine or 10 segments is uncertain at present, but 10 is the more probable figure. This is so because the only apianurine with known articulated thorax, Boedaspis ensifer Whittington and Bohlin, 1958 has 10 thoracic segments. I have prepared the articulated type specimen more fully, and there are definitely 10 thoracic segments, but the pygidium is unfortunately missing. It is, however, highly unlikely that there were originally more than 10 segments present, and this number is in fact probably a synapomorphy shared with the Acidaspidinae (e.g. Primaspis, Acidaspis, Dudleyaspis and others). The discovery of articulated apianurine specimens, in particular of Calipernurus, will thus provide a test of the hypothesis of the homologous ''true major border spine''. 3. Selenopeltinae. Returning to the Selenopeltinae, the ''three and one up'' rule can be immediately applied in one genus only, Ceratocephalina. The pygidium is known for five species of this genus. In C. vexator Pfibyl et al., 1986 there are three spine pairs between the major pair (Pfibyl & Vanek 1966; pi. 6, fig. 4). In C. charlesworthi Chatterton and Perry, 1983 and C. sevastopuloi Chatterton and Perry, 1983 (Fig. 1) the bases of the major spines lie above the furcation between the third and fourth spine pairs (counted from the sagittal line), and in C. tridens Whittington, 1956a the bases are above the fourth spine pair (Whittington 1956a; pi. 16, fig. 17; Hu 1974; pi. 2, fig. 18). In C. tricornis (Barrande, 1846) there may be only two pairs of spines between the major pair, but there is ample space for one more between these and the major spines. Only one pygidium of C. tricornis has been figured (Bruton 1968a; Pfibyl & Vanek 1966), and the missing third spine pair may simply be broken and lost in this specimen. In all these species the major spine is connected by a pleural ridge to the anterior axial ring. The large pygidial spines in Ceratocephalina are identified here as the true major border spines.^nOnly one other selenopeltine species is known that may possess three pairs of medial secondary border spines, Miraspis jamesii (Salter, 1853). Salter described and figured two pygidia, both with three pairs of spines between the major pair, and an additional one or two pairs outside it. Other Miraspis of comparable age (around the Llandeilo) have more numerous medial secondary spine pairs (M. solitaria Reed, 1935 has about five to nine pairs; M. sp. of Whittington (1956a) has four).^nOther selenopeltine taxa have a more complex pygidial morphology, and the number of small border spines is, as far as known, usually not stable even intraspecifically. In Miraspis mira, for example, the number of small spines between the major pair varies between 10 and 17 (Snajdr 1988a). All selenopeltine genera have in common one pair of large, more or less ''supramarginal'', pygidial spines connected to the first axial ring by a pleural ridge. There are invariably nine thoracic segments in taxa with known thorax. The large spine pair in each of these taxa is identified as the true major border spine pair (see also ''Origin of the true major border spines'' earlier in this section).^n4. Ceratocephalinae. Finally we turn to the most complex of all odontopleurid genera, Ceratocephala. I do not know of Ceratocephala species which have other than 10 thoracic segments, though Whittington (1956b, p. 516) in a statement concerning Ceratocephala species said ''some of which have 10 thoracic segments'', possibly indicating the presence of other numbers as well. From the arguments presented below it follows that all Ceratocephalaspecies must by definition have 10 thoracic segments. The true major border spine cannot immediately be recognised in adults, but its identity is revealed through the ontogeny of the last meraspid stages.^nCrucial here are the last three meraspid stages of the pygidium (degrees 7-9). These are well known in C. triacantheis Whittington and Evitt, 1954 (Figs 2 and 3). In the holaspid-minus-three stage (degree 7) of this species (Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 14), the anterior unreleased (eighth thoracic) segment has a barbed, posterolaterally directed anterior pleural spine, and a more sparsely barbed, dorsally set, posteromedially directed posterior pleural spine. The next (ninth) segment shows a very similar configuration of spines. The anterior spine of the tenth segment is large, visible laterally to the posterior spine of the ninth segment. The posterior spine of the tenth segment cannot be seen in dorsal view but must be present under the overlapping posterior spine of the ninth segment. The paired axial tubercles of the eleventh, i.e. pygidial, segment are present, but no spines belonging to this segment can be discerned.^nIn the holaspid-minus-two stage (degree 8) the anterior and posterior pleural spines of the anterior unreleased (ninth thoracic) segment are followed posteriorly first by a heavily barbed (i.e. secondary) spine and then by a sparsely barbed, more dorsally set spine (particularly clearly seen in Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 8). Posterior to this is a fairly large spine pair followed by a short median spine. Sometimes this can be seen to have a bifurcate tip, composed of a pair of tiny spines (Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 8; Whittington and Evitt 1954; pi. 26, fig. 6), sometimes it is less clear (Fig. 21; Shaw 1968, pi. 11, fig. 10).^nAlso in the last meraspid stage (degree 9) the posterior pleural spine of the (unreleased tenth) anterior segment is in a more dorsal position than the other spines, but its barbs are now more similar to those of the anterior pleural spine (Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 16; Whittington and Evitt 1954; pi. 26, fig. 7). The median spine is always undivided in this stage. In the next ontogenetic stage, the first holaspid, the tenth segment has been released into the thorax, and the remaining pygidium shows only one lateral pair and one median spine.^nThe interpretation of Ceratocephala now presents less problems. With Calipernurusin mind and the ontogenetic information at hand we recognise that the posteromedian secondary spine pairs can become fused (or unreleased) in odontopleurids. The fusion of the posterior spine pair in Ceratocephala was suggested in a modified interpretation already by Shaw (1974, p. 47). From the evidence presented above it follows that the median pygidial spine in Ceratocephala is homologous with at least one of the medial secondary spine pairs of other odontopleurids. The available evidence, presented below, indicates that both the first and the second (from sagittal line) medial spine pairs are involved. The line of evidence is as follows.^nIn the two last meraspid stages (Figs 2 and 3) the posterior pleural spines of the ninth segment converge strongly backwards, and cross the pygidium, while all spines posterior to this are directed posteriorly to weakly posteromedially and are evenly spaced. This condition of posterior thoracic spines converging across the pygidium is present in odontopleurid genera in which the posterior pleural spines become progressively more posteriorly directed from anterior to posterior in the thorax. It is most strongly developed in Xanionurus IRadiaspis. The spine, serially homologous with a posterior pleural spine, on the tenth postcephalic segment in C. triacantheis is more dorsally set and is less barbed than the spine anterior and those posterior to it (Fig. 21).^nThese are features typical for the true major border spine. The posterior pleural spine on the tenth postcephalic segment in Ceratocephala is regarded here as the true major border spine. In holaspid Ceratocephala it is the posterior pleural spine of the tenth thoracic segment. The outer ''major'' spine pair in the holaspid Ceratocephala pygidium (in species with three spines, i.e. all stratigraphically early species) is accordingly regarded here as homologous with the third secondary spine pair, i.e. the anterior spine of the eleventh segment (Fig. 1). There is no evidence that this spine consists of two or more fused spines. The median spine must thus include all medial secondary spine pairs posterior to the most lateral, i.e. the third. The second medial spine pair is apparently developed only as the most posterior, tiny pair visible in the above-mentioned meraspid specimens (Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 8; Whittington and Evitt 1954; pi. 26, fig. 6). The most medial (''first'') pair never develops, since the twelfth postcephalic segment (to which it belongs) never develops in Ceratocephala. The second pair appears only in the penultimate meraspid stage and the complete fusion of the medial spine pairs takes place between this stage and the last meraspid stage, the time when the first pair should otherwise have appeared.^nThe ontogeny of C. triacantheis indicates that the median pygidial spine of Ceratocephala is a process formed from:^n(1) the failure of release of independent border spines posterior to the third medial secondary spine pair, due to the non-development of the twelfth postcephalic segment.^n(2) the posterior elongation of this undifferentiated area to form a ''pseudo-spine''.^nThe ontogenetic information of Ceratocephala thus conforms with the hypothesis of a homologous true major border spine in odontopleurids. Support for this inference comes from the lack of a pleural ridge in Ceratocephala pygidia. The bases of the lateral spine pair commonly continue as weak elevations straight anteriorly almost to the anterior margin.^nThe sister groups Selenopeltinae + Ceratocephalinae and Odontopleurinae (see computer analysis) both have nine true thoracic segments (the tenth segment in Ceratocephala is then counted as part of the pygidium). This number is therefore regarded as plesiomorphic for the Selenopeltinae. The discussion above indicates that the true major border spine on the tenth postcephalic segment, whether the latter is released or unreleased, is homologous in all discussed taxa. In this context the number of thoracic segments is thus secondary to this feature. The presence of 10 thoracic segments in Ceratocephala is apomorphic and the identifica- tion of the true major border spine on the tenth thoracic segment thus confirms rather than contradicts the plesiomorphic condition of nine segments in the Cerato- cephalinae and Selenopeltinae.^nWe now have the evidence forming the basis for the previous statement that pygidia of Proceratocephala and Ceratocephala look superficially similar but are of different origin. The two large, lateral spines and the single median spine in Proceratocephala (Fig. 7b) are respectively the true major border spines (i.e. the posterior pleural spines of the tenth postcephalic segment) and a posteromedian, uniquely derived process of the pygidial margin. In Ceratocephala, however, the lateral spine pair are the third medial secondary spine pair (i.e. the anterior pleural spine of the eleventh postcephalic segment) and the median ''spine'' includes the unreleased secondary medial secondary spine pair. Further, in Proceratocephala the anterior pleural spine of the first pygidial segment is well developed, while in Ceratocephala there is no spine anterior to the large, paired spine, just a barbed pygidial margin ending with the articulating process. This presence of a lateral secondary border spine in Proceratocephala has not been noted previously, but it is the crucial piece of evidence confirming the non-homology between pygidia of Proceratocephala and Ceratocephala. We see a far-reaching convergence but very little homology.^nThe much discussed division of the tenth thoracic segment in many Ceratocephala species into three separate elements is now well documented (Chatterton & Ludvigsen 1976; Thomas 1981) and an interesting autapomorphy. It is of no consequence for the present discussion and just further emphasises the difference between the nine anterior thoracic segments and the tenth. The presence of more than three (i.e. five, seven or nine) spines in the pygidia of many post-Ordovician Ceratocephala species is a further development from three-spined pygidia, as discussed by Chatterton and Perry (1983) and need not be discussed here.^nThe ontogeny of Ceratocara gen. nov. is unknown but the pygidium is exceedingly similar to that of Ceratocephala. From the hypothesis of a homologous true major border spine on the tenth postcephalic segment, it follows that the pygidium of Ceratocara must have gone through developmental stages similar to those in Ceratocephala and Ceratocara must have 10 thoracic segments.^nRosa''s rule. There are many examples of numerical features in trilobites that vary in early representatives of a group and that later become fixed to a certain number or show a reduced variation. The number of thoracic segments, for example, varies much in many Cambrian groups of trilobites, even intraspecifically (Bergstrom & Levi-Setti 1978), while in later forms the number is, with few exceptions, stable (see Jaanusson 1975, p. 216 for a review). Another example is the number of pleural ridges that form the pygidial margin in encrinurids, a number that varies much in early forms but that is later fixed to seven plus mucro in Encrinurus and sister taxa (see Ramskold 1986). This general tendency for evolution to go from variation to fixation was described by Rosa (1899) and is here called Rosa''s rule. When applicable, it may be used to polarise character transformations. Applied to the spines of the odontopleurid pygidium, it would indicate that members of the Selenopeltinae are the most primitive odontopleurids, since the number of secondary border spines varies much in the group. In the Acidaspidinae, Odontopleurinae, and Apianurinae the number is much more stable, and in many genera (some discussed above) the number of medial secondary spines is completely fixed.^nIt may be concluded that the primitive condition for the Apianurinae and Odontopleurinae is to possess three medial secondary spine pairs in the pygidium. That this number is also present in the pygidium of many Ceratocephalina and possibly in Miraspis jamesii, together with the increasing number of spines in stratigraphically younger selenopeltine species, indicates the former taxa show the same plesiomorphic condition for the Selenopeltinae. Rosa''s rule is therefore not applicable in this case.^nOntogeny: Above^nPolarity. Presence of true major border spines on the pygidium is regarded as primitive (state 0).';

Anterior and posterior to these are a number of smaller, marginal, ''secondary'' spines, here called the lateral and medial secondary spines, respectively. One or more of the lateral secondary border spines is homologous with the anterior pleural spine/spines in the thoracic segments, though this is rarely obvious. Among selenopeltine genera this is best seen in Proceratocephala, where there is a single ventrolaterally directed, short, blunt spine anterolaterally on the pygidium (Fig. 7a). This spine is similar to the short anterior pleural spine of the posteriormost thoracic segment, and is clearly serially homologous with this. Miraspis (Fig. 1) and Ceratonurushave a small number of lateral secondary spines, similar in size and shape to the anterior pleural spine of the posterior thoracic segments. The posteriormost segment in Miraspis mira actually has three small anterior spines, and in the pygidium the number of lateral secondary spines varies between two and four (Snajdr 1988a). In other selenopeltine genera the lateral secondary spines are usually more numerous, and in several genera they are much reduced in size or are completely lost.^nThe number of medial secondary spines varies much in the Selenopeltinae. However, in the other odontopleurid subfamilies it is usually stable, and the identification of the true major border spine in various odontopleurid genera is often dependent on the correct identification of the medial secondary spines. This is discussed in detail below, mainly on the basis of conditions in holaspides.^nTheoretical pygidial spine distribution. As is shown by several features discussed in this paper, it is highly probable that the primitive condition in the odontopleurid pygidium is to possess one anterior (''secondary'', more ventral) and one posterior (''major'', more dorsal) spine per segment, in thorax and pygidium alike. The primitive condition of the pygidium is apparently to be composed of three segments, which decrease in size posteriorly, totalling six spine pairs.^nThe theoretical distribution of these spines would be: a small first (anterior; the lateral secondary spine) followed by a large second (posterior; the true major border spine), a small third (anterior), a medium-sized fourth (posterior), a small fifth (anterior), and a small sixth (posterior). The third segment is by necessity very small and there is never more than one spine pair (the fifth?) developed. Pairs three to five are the three pairs of medial secondary border spines. This theoretical, primitive distribution is rarely obvious in adults, but is present in juveniles of some taxa (best seen in Apianurus).^nThe ''three and one up'' rule. An outgroup, the odontopleurine genus Diacanthaspis, will first be considered. The configuration of the pygidial spines in this genus provides basic information for the understanding of other odontopleurids. The various conditions in the Apianurinae must also be reviewed since they provide clues to the condition in Ceratocephala and Ceratocara.^n1. Diacanthaspis. The following discussion is based entirely on material figured by Whittington (1956a), illustrated schematically here in Fig. 1. Whittington described a number of Diacanthaspis species with varying pygidial morphology. These species, all assumed to possess nine thoracic segments, show all possible intermediate morphological stages from stout, near marginal, true major border spines to a reduction of these spines to tiny tubercles.^nThere are three main criteria for identifying the true major border spine: (1) its position relative to the medial and lateral secondary border spines; (2) it position relative the pleural ridge and (3) its ontogeny. The most primitive (in this particular character) of Whittington''s (1956a) species is Diacanthaspis scitula (Fig. la). There are three pairs of medial secondary spines (in Whittington''s photographs; in the reconstruction in his fig. 8 only two pairs are seen). The largest border spine is stout, with a supramarginal base above the furcation between the third and fourth secondary spine pair (counting laterally from midline), and there are four lateral secondary spine pairs. The largest border spine is connected by a pleural ridge to the first axial ring. We can identify this basic spine pattern with three medial spine pairs followed laterally by a supramarginal ''major'' border spine by counting, from the sagittal line, three marginal spines followed by one that is more dorsally set. This is here called the ''three and one up'' formula. The largest border spine in D. scitula is called the true major border spine.^nUsing the formula in D. cooperi and D. orandensis we find, at ''one up'', the true major border spines easily identifiable, though much reduced in size and set farther from the margin (Fig. lb). The number of lateral secondary spines is here three. Using the formula in D. secreta we cound three medial secondary spines, and at ''one up'' we find a small spine on the pleural ridge (Fig. lc). The ridge is connected to the first axial ring but ends against the border between the third and fourth secondary spine pairs (counted from the posterior). Although Whittington (1956a, fig. 8) reconstructed this spine as the only prominent spine in the pleural area, he did not comment on it in the text. There are three lateral secondary spine pairs also in this species. All lateral and medial secondary spine are subequal in size.^nIn D. lepida (Fig. Id) we find the most lateral pair (the third) of the medial secondary spines to be larger than the other, and at ''one up'' we find, on the pleural ridge, a small vertical spine, only slightly larger than the numerous spines of the surrounding prosopon. There are three pairs of lateral secondary spines. The pleural ridge ends closer (relative to D. secreta) to the base of the most laterally situated of the medial secondary spines. If we had not traced the true major spine through the successive morphological stages described above (not in stratigraphic order, nor to be mistaken for phylogenetic stages), the enlarged secondary spines would be mistaken for the true major border spines. This has indeed always been the case. In D. ulrichi we find the third pair of medial secondary spines still larger (Fig. le), the true major border spine is but a tiny tubercle, and is impossible to identify without the previous information presented here. This type is developed further in odontopleurines like Acanthalomina.^n2. Apianurinae. With this information we now turn to the Apianurinae. In all species of Apianurus the three medial spine pairs are strong and outside of them are generally three or four lateral spines more equally sized. Anteromedially from the furcation between the third and fourth (from the posterior) spine pair, there is a large, vertical spine, connected to the first axial ring by a pleural ridge (see Opik 1937; Whittington 1956a; Bruton 1965, 1966b, 1968b; Shaw 1968; Neben & Krueger 1973; Hu 1974; Chatterton & Ludvigsen 1976; Chatterton 1980). This is the true major pygidial spine, as evidenced by:^n(1) its position relative to the third and fourth pairs of secondary spines.^n(2) its position on the abaxial termination of the pleural ridge.^n(3) its ontogeny, in that in late meraspides and early holaspides it is similar to thoracic posterior pleural spines.^nIt can be concluded that it is the posterior pleural spine homologue of the first pygidial segment and thus homologous (more precisely serially homologous - see below) with the true major border spine in Diacanthaspis.^nIn the apianurine Boedaspis Whittington and Bohlin, 1958 (see also Bruton 1966a, 1968b) there are three medial, marginal spine pairs followed by a large marginal spine connected by a strong pleural ridge to the first axial ring (Fig. 1). There is no spine or large tubercle on the pleural ridge indicating a presence of a reduced, supramarginal border spine. Lateral to the large spine are five or more smaller marginal spines. The large spines are thus apparently the true major border spines.^nThe apianurine Calipernurus Whittington, 1956a has a strongly modified pygidium. My interpretation is that the large pygidial spine pair in Calipernurusis really the true major border spine pair. Supporting evidence comes from the morphology of Apianurus. In Apianurus there are spines, serially homologous with anterior pleural spines in other odontopleurids, developed in the pygidium only. In the last meraspid stage of the Apianurus pygidium there are no anterior pleural spines developed on the unreleased thoracic segment, though the complete number of pygidial secondary border spines is already present (Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 26). In this stage there are four segments, three of which are pygidial. The true major border spine is on the anterior pygidial segment, as are two lateral secondary border spines, one or both of which comprise the (homologue of the) anterior pleural spine of this segment. The most lateral of the three medial spine pairs is smaller than the second and is regarded here as the anterior pleural spine of the second pygidial segment, whereas the second medial secondary spine is regarded as the posterior pleural spine of the same segment. The most posterior spine pair belongs to the third pygidial segment. This interpretation of the medial secondary spine pairs is the same as for other odontopleurids.^nA comparison of the pygidium of Calipernurus with that of Apianurus reveals considerable similarities. There are, as in Apianurus, a few secondary spines anterolateral to the major pair. The configuration of the median border spines also shows similarities to that of Apianurus. There are three medium-sized spines flanked by a smaller pair between the larger ones. This condition much resembles that of late meraspid and early holaspid pygidia of Apianurus (Whittington 1956a; pi. 18, figs 20-24, and pi. 19, fig. 26), the only notable difference being one spine less in Calipernurus. The different sizes of the two outer medial secondary spine pairs in Calipernurus suggest that these, as suggested for Apianurus, are the anterior and posterior pleural spines of the second pygidial segment. In several pygidia of C. insolitus the median spine has a double tip (Whittington 1956a; pi. 24; examined BM material). This indicates that the median spine may be composed of two incompletely fused spines. The secondary spines between the large spine pair in Calipernurus may thus be interpreted as representing three pairs, a smaller outer followed by a medium-sized middle and a fused median pair. If this interpretation is correct, then the plesiomorphic (for odontopleurids) condition of three medial secondary spine pairs is retained, though modified, also in Calipernurus. The incomplete development of the spines of the third segment is paralleled in the poor development of the third axial ring, which is virtually absent.^nA conceivable alternative interpretation of the origin of this pygidium can be hypothesised from the ontogenies of Apianurus barbatus Whittington, 1956a and A. parabarbatus Chatterton and Ludvigsen, 1976, and should be examined. The holaspis-minus-one transitory pygidia of these species (Whittington 1956a, pi. 19, fig. 26; Chatterton 1980, pi. 19, fig. 26) are exceedingly similar to the Calipernurus pygidium. The latter type could perhaps have arisen through the failure in the last meraspid stage to release the last (tenth?) thoracic segment from the pygidium into the thorax, i.e. through a paedomorphic process, such as post-displacement (McNamara 1986). The bases of the broken true major border spines can be seen in the pleural area of the last meraspid stage pygidium of Apianurus. In Calipernurus the pleural area is very small, with no sign of spines (absence confirmed in many specimens examined by me). If the true major spines are situated there, they have been reduced to oblivion. The interpretation of the three medial secondary spine pairs is not affected by this hypothesis.^nThis latter alternative is regarded here as unlikely, for the following reasons. Thoracic segments in both genera, also when unreleased from the transitory pygidium, completely lack anterior pleural spines. The anterior segment in the pygidium of Calipernuruspossesses such spines, and it is therefore unlikely that it is an unreleased thoracic segment. Ir addition, the last meraspid stage pygidium of Apianurus h is four well-defined axial rings. If the pygidium of Calipernurus corresponds to this stage, it would be expected to have more than the two or possibly three rings that are present.^nIt may be concluded that the major spine in the pygidium of Calipernurus is the true major border spine and homologous with that spine in Apianurus. It can therefore be predicted that articulated material, when found, of these genera will show that Apianurus and Calipernurus have the same number of thoracic segments. Whether this means nine or 10 segments is uncertain at present, but 10 is the more probable figure. This is so because the only apianurine with known articulated thorax, Boedaspis ensifer Whittington and Bohlin, 1958 has 10 thoracic segments. I have prepared the articulated type specimen more fully, and there are definitely 10 thoracic segments, but the pygidium is unfortunately missing. It is, however, highly unlikely that there were originally more than 10 segments present, and this number is in fact probably a synapomorphy shared with the Acidaspidinae (e.g. Primaspis, Acidaspis, Dudleyaspis and others). The discovery of articulated apianurine specimens, in particular of Calipernurus, will thus provide a test of the hypothesis of the homologous ''true major border spine''. 3. Selenopeltinae. Returning to the Selenopeltinae, the ''three and one up'' rule can be immediately applied in one genus only, Ceratocephalina. The pygidium is known for five species of this genus. In C. vexator Pfibyl et al., 1986 there are three spine pairs between the major pair (Pfibyl & Vanek 1966; pi. 6, fig. 4). In C. charlesworthi Chatterton and Perry, 1983 and C. sevastopuloi Chatterton and Perry, 1983 (Fig. 1) the bases of the major spines lie above the furcation between the third and fourth spine pairs (counted from the sagittal line), and in C. tridens Whittington, 1956a the bases are above the fourth spine pair (Whittington 1956a; pi. 16, fig. 17; Hu 1974; pi. 2, fig. 18). In C. tricornis (Barrande, 1846) there may be only two pairs of spines between the major pair, but there is ample space for one more between these and the major spines. Only one pygidium of C. tricornis has been figured (Bruton 1968a; Pfibyl & Vanek 1966), and the missing third spine pair may simply be broken and lost in this specimen. In all these species the major spine is connected by a pleural ridge to the anterior axial ring. The large pygidial spines in Ceratocephalina are identified here as the true major border spines.^nOnly one other selenopeltine species is known that may possess three pairs of medial secondary border spines, Miraspis jamesii (Salter, 1853). Salter described and figured two pygidia, both with three pairs of spines between the major pair, and an additional one or two pairs outside it. Other Miraspis of comparable age (around the Llandeilo) have more numerous medial secondary spine pairs (M. solitaria Reed, 1935 has about five to nine pairs; M. sp. of Whittington (1956a) has four).^nOther selenopeltine taxa have a more complex pygidial morphology, and the number of small border spines is, as far as known, usually not stable even intraspecifically. In Miraspis mira, for example, the number of small spines between the major pair varies between 10 and 17 (Snajdr 1988a). All selenopeltine genera have in common one pair of large, more or less ''supramarginal'', pygidial spines connected to the first axial ring by a pleural ridge. There are invariably nine thoracic segments in taxa with known thorax. The large spine pair in each of these taxa is identified as the true major border spine pair (see also ''Origin of the true major border spines'' earlier in this section).^n4. Ceratocephalinae. Finally we turn to the most complex of all odontopleurid genera, Ceratocephala. I do not know of Ceratocephala species which have other than 10 thoracic segments, though Whittington (1956b, p. 516) in a statement concerning Ceratocephala species said ''some of which have 10 thoracic segments'', possibly indicating the presence of other numbers as well. From the arguments presented below it follows that all Ceratocephalaspecies must by definition have 10 thoracic segments. The true major border spine cannot immediately be recognised in adults, but its identity is revealed through the ontogeny of the last meraspid stages.^nCrucial here are the last three meraspid stages of the pygidium (degrees 7-9). These are well known in C. triacantheis Whittington and Evitt, 1954 (Figs 2 and 3). In the holaspid-minus-three stage (degree 7) of this species (Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 14), the anterior unreleased (eighth thoracic) segment has a barbed, posterolaterally directed anterior pleural spine, and a more sparsely barbed, dorsally set, posteromedially directed posterior pleural spine. The next (ninth) segment shows a very similar configuration of spines. The anterior spine of the tenth segment is large, visible laterally to the posterior spine of the ninth segment. The posterior spine of the tenth segment cannot be seen in dorsal view but must be present under the overlapping posterior spine of the ninth segment. The paired axial tubercles of the eleventh, i.e. pygidial, segment are present, but no spines belonging to this segment can be discerned.^nIn the holaspid-minus-two stage (degree 8) the anterior and posterior pleural spines of the anterior unreleased (ninth thoracic) segment are followed posteriorly first by a heavily barbed (i.e. secondary) spine and then by a sparsely barbed, more dorsally set spine (particularly clearly seen in Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 8). Posterior to this is a fairly large spine pair followed by a short median spine. Sometimes this can be seen to have a bifurcate tip, composed of a pair of tiny spines (Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 8; Whittington and Evitt 1954; pi. 26, fig. 6), sometimes it is less clear (Fig. 21; Shaw 1968, pi. 11, fig. 10).^nAlso in the last meraspid stage (degree 9) the posterior pleural spine of the (unreleased tenth) anterior segment is in a more dorsal position than the other spines, but its barbs are now more similar to those of the anterior pleural spine (Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 16; Whittington and Evitt 1954; pi. 26, fig. 7). The median spine is always undivided in this stage. In the next ontogenetic stage, the first holaspid, the tenth segment has been released into the thorax, and the remaining pygidium shows only one lateral pair and one median spine.^nThe interpretation of Ceratocephala now presents less problems. With Calipernurusin mind and the ontogenetic information at hand we recognise that the posteromedian secondary spine pairs can become fused (or unreleased) in odontopleurids. The fusion of the posterior spine pair in Ceratocephala was suggested in a modified interpretation already by Shaw (1974, p. 47). From the evidence presented above it follows that the median pygidial spine in Ceratocephala is homologous with at least one of the medial secondary spine pairs of other odontopleurids. The available evidence, presented below, indicates that both the first and the second (from sagittal line) medial spine pairs are involved. The line of evidence is as follows.^nIn the two last meraspid stages (Figs 2 and 3) the posterior pleural spines of the ninth segment converge strongly backwards, and cross the pygidium, while all spines posterior to this are directed posteriorly to weakly posteromedially and are evenly spaced. This condition of posterior thoracic spines converging across the pygidium is present in odontopleurid genera in which the posterior pleural spines become progressively more posteriorly directed from anterior to posterior in the thorax. It is most strongly developed in Xanionurus IRadiaspis. The spine, serially homologous with a posterior pleural spine, on the tenth postcephalic segment in C. triacantheis is more dorsally set and is less barbed than the spine anterior and those posterior to it (Fig. 21).^nThese are features typical for the true major border spine. The posterior pleural spine on the tenth postcephalic segment in Ceratocephala is regarded here as the true major border spine. In holaspid Ceratocephala it is the posterior pleural spine of the tenth thoracic segment. The outer ''major'' spine pair in the holaspid Ceratocephala pygidium (in species with three spines, i.e. all stratigraphically early species) is accordingly regarded here as homologous with the third secondary spine pair, i.e. the anterior spine of the eleventh segment (Fig. 1). There is no evidence that this spine consists of two or more fused spines. The median spine must thus include all medial secondary spine pairs posterior to the most lateral, i.e. the third. The second medial spine pair is apparently developed only as the most posterior, tiny pair visible in the above-mentioned meraspid specimens (Chatterton 1980; pi. 19, fig. 8; Whittington and Evitt 1954; pi. 26, fig. 6). The most medial (''first'') pair never develops, since the twelfth postcephalic segment (to which it belongs) never develops in Ceratocephala. The second pair appears only in the penultimate meraspid stage and the complete fusion of the medial spine pairs takes place between this stage and the last meraspid stage, the time when the first pair should otherwise have appeared.^nThe ontogeny of C. triacantheis indicates that the median pygidial spine of Ceratocephala is a process formed from:^n(1) the failure of release of independent border spines posterior to the third medial secondary spine pair, due to the non-development of the twelfth postcephalic segment.^n(2) the posterior elongation of this undifferentiated area to form a ''pseudo-spine''.^nThe ontogenetic information of Ceratocephala thus conforms with the hypothesis of a homologous true major border spine in odontopleurids. Support for this inference comes from the lack of a pleural ridge in Ceratocephala pygidia. The bases of the lateral spine pair commonly continue as weak elevations straight anteriorly almost to the anterior margin.^nThe sister groups Selenopeltinae + Ceratocephalinae and Odontopleurinae (see computer analysis) both have nine true thoracic segments (the tenth segment in Ceratocephala is then counted as part of the pygidium). This number is therefore regarded as plesiomorphic for the Selenopeltinae. The discussion above indicates that the true major border spine on the tenth postcephalic segment, whether the latter is released or unreleased, is homologous in all discussed taxa. In this context the number of thoracic segments is thus secondary to this feature. The presence of 10 thoracic segments in Ceratocephala is apomorphic and the identifica- tion of the true major border spine on the tenth thoracic segment thus confirms rather than contradicts the plesiomorphic condition of nine segments in the Cerato- cephalinae and Selenopeltinae.^nWe now have the evidence forming the basis for the previous statement that pygidia of Proceratocephala and Ceratocephala look superficially similar but are of different origin. The two large, lateral spines and the single median spine in Proceratocephala (Fig. 7b) are respectively the true major border spines (i.e. the posterior pleural spines of the tenth postcephalic segment) and a posteromedian, uniquely derived process of the pygidial margin. In Ceratocephala, however, the lateral spine pair are the third medial secondary spine pair (i.e. the anterior pleural spine of the eleventh postcephalic segment) and the median ''spine'' includes the unreleased secondary medial secondary spine pair. Further, in Proceratocephala the anterior pleural spine of the first pygidial segment is well developed, while in Ceratocephala there is no spine anterior to the large, paired spine, just a barbed pygidial margin ending with the articulating process. This presence of a lateral secondary border spine in Proceratocephala has not been noted previously, but it is the crucial piece of evidence confirming the non-homology between pygidia of Proceratocephala and Ceratocephala. We see a far-reaching convergence but very little homology.^nThe much discussed division of the tenth thoracic segment in many Ceratocephala species into three separate elements is now well documented (Chatterton & Ludvigsen 1976; Thomas 1981) and an interesting autapomorphy. It is of no consequence for the present discussion and just further emphasises the difference between the nine anterior thoracic segments and the tenth. The presence of more than three (i.e. five, seven or nine) spines in the pygidia of many post-Ordovician Ceratocephala species is a further development from three-spined pygidia, as discussed by Chatterton and Perry (1983) and need not be discussed here.^nThe ontogeny of Ceratocara gen. nov. is unknown but the pygidium is exceedingly similar to that of Ceratocephala. From the hypothesis of a homologous true major border spine on the tenth postcephalic segment, it follows that the pygidium of Ceratocara must have gone through developmental stages similar to those in Ceratocephala and Ceratocara must have 10 thoracic segments.^nRosa''s rule. There are many examples of numerical features in trilobites that vary in early representatives of a group and that later become fixed to a certain number or show a reduced variation. The number of thoracic segments, for example, varies much in many Cambrian groups of trilobites, even intraspecifically (Bergstrom & Levi-Setti 1978), while in later forms the number is, with few exceptions, stable (see Jaanusson 1975, p. 216 for a review). Another example is the number of pleural ridges that form the pygidial margin in encrinurids, a number that varies much in early forms but that is later fixed to seven plus mucro in Encrinurus and sister taxa (see Ramskold 1986). This general tendency for evolution to go from variation to fixation was described by Rosa (1899) and is here called Rosa''s rule. When applicable, it may be used to polarise character transformations. Applied to the spines of the odontopleurid pygidium, it would indicate that members of the Selenopeltinae are the most primitive odontopleurids, since the number of secondary border spines varies much in the group. In the Acidaspidinae, Odontopleurinae, and Apianurinae the number is much more stable, and in many genera (some discussed above) the number of medial secondary spines is completely fixed.^nIt may be concluded that the primitive condition for the Apianurinae and Odontopleurinae is to possess three medial secondary spine pairs in the pygidium. That this number is also present in the pygidium of many Ceratocephalina and possibly in Miraspis jamesii, together with the increasing number of spines in stratigraphically younger selenopeltine species, indicates the former taxa show the same plesiomorphic condition for the Selenopeltinae. Rosa''s rule is therefore not applicable in this case.^nOntogeny. The true major border spines are the posterior pleural spines of their segment and, as such, originate in a position more dorsal than the position of the anterior pleural spines. They are not, however, supramarginally set in the sense of the word used throughout this work (Ceratocephala).^nPolarity. Non-supramarginal major border spines are regarded as primitive (state 1).';
