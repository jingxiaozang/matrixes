        [Character comments]
        	TEXT CHARACTER=1 TEXT='The presence and nature of tubercles on the anterior border is divided into three distinct states. This is an easily identified character, and the confidence in assigned states is high.^nOntogeny. In the earliest meraspid stages of Kettneraspis there are four spines on the anterior border {clavata, lenzi, longstaffei). A row of prominent, spinose tubercles is then present on the anterior border of Kettneraspis from early meraspid stages and onward (clavata, cf. williamsi, Mackenzie spp.). In all these species the anterior border spines decrease in prominence during ontogeny. In Exallaspis the border is smooth at least from early meraspid stages on. In Leonaspis the ontogeny of this character, as of the following characters, is unknown.^nOutgroup comparison. Diacanthaspis: the border is spinose, usually carrying a single row of spines of tubercles. Meadowtownella: The border is smooth (with a minute granulation).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=2 TEXT='The angle of convergence (forward) of the anterior branch of the facial suture, between alpha and gamma, to the sagittal line, times two. This is measured in dorsal view. With deflections from the true dorsal view the angle will change (decrease in posterior tilt, increase in anterior tilt of specimen). In several species measured from photographs, in particular those with strong convergence, the confidence in the angular measurement is low. This has caused the division of this potentially multidivisible character into only two states. For these the confidence in state assignments are high.^nOntogeny. In Kettneraspis and Exallaspis the sutures converge strongly in early meraspides, and from late meraspides onward the angle has approximately reached the adult state.^nOutgroup comparison. The sutures converge strongly in Diacanthaspis and Meadowtownella.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='The anterior branch of the facial suture may curve inward opposite the lateral border furrow, causing a weak concavity in the lateral cranidial margin immediately behind the anterolateral cranidial corner. Some quality of preservation and illustration is necessary to determine the course of the suture, and confidence in state assignments is low in several species.^nOntogeny. There is a sutural concavity from meraspid stages onward in Exallaspis and in some Kettneraspis (Mackenzie spp.) In other Kettneraspis the sutures are straight or convex in early stages (clavata, cf. williamsi).^nOutgroup comparison. Diacanthaspis; concavity absent (state 1). Meadowtownella: present (state 0).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='This is the position of the centre of the eye/palpebral lobe relative to the lateral lobes and furrows of the glabella, as seen in dorsal view. With deviation from a strict dorsal view the apparent eye position will vary slightly. This deviation increases with the height of the eyes.^nOntogeny. In Exallaspis the palpebral lobe is opposite S3 in the protaspid, opposite S2 to L2 in early meraspides, and it migrates posteriorly during ontogeny. In Kettneraspis the palpebral lobe is approximately opposite S1 to L2 in early meraspid stages, after which it migrates posteriorly.^nOutgroup comparison. Diacanthaspis: the palpebral lobe is opposite anterior one-third to mid L1. Meadowtownella: it is opposite mid L1 to occipital furrow.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='This is the ratio of the size of L2 to L1. It is measured as the L2 lobe length times width over ditto for L1 (exsag., trans.). Width measurements are made in the bottom of the axial and longitudinal furrows, and length measurements at the lobe margins. These places of measurement yield the most reproducible results. In particular the apparent size of L2 is influenced by specimen tilt (lobe size decreases with anterior tilt), and in some species, in particular of Leonaspis, the anterior margin of L1 is indistinct. Measured values are therefore in many cases approximate, and state assignments sometimes ambiguous.^nOntogeny. In Exallaspis and Kettneraspis L1 and L2 are of subequal size in early meraspides, the relative size of L1 then increases during ontogeny, and from probably holaspid stages the adult state is reached.^nOutgroup comparison. Diacanthaspis: L2 is only slightly smaller than L1. Meadowtownella: L2 is considerably smaller than L1.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='Ontogeny. In Exallaspis the sculpture consists of tubercles that become lower during ontogeny.

Median, occipital spines are usually broken, and absence of an occipital organ cannot be confirmed. State assignments to ''present'' are, however, always unambiguous.^nOntogeny. It is not clear whether or not an occipital organ is present in early stages of Exallaspis. In Kettneraspis species with an occipital organ in adults, this is present at least from early adult stages, and possibly in a modified form from early meraspid stages (lenzi).^nOutgroup comparison.

Such assignments cannot be entered into the phylogenetic analysis, and the state must be given as unknown.^nOntogeny. The median tubercle in Exallaspis is of similar relative height during ontogeny. In Kettneraspisthere is commonly a long median spine in early stages. It usually decreases in length during ontogeny, from a long spine to a tubercle (clavata, cf. williamsi, belli) or to a short spine (longstaffei). Sometimes there is almost no reduction in length (beni, boltoni). In Kettneraspis species with a very short, truncated median spine in meraspides, this is reduced to a tubercle in adults (jaanussoni, lenzi).^nOutgroup comparison.

In a meraspid degree 0 exoskeleton of Kettneraspis jaanussoni (Fig. 2) the posterior pleural spine of the unreleased first thoracic segment is extremely long and robust. In a meraspid degree 4 exoskeleton the spine of the first segment is relatively shorter than in the degree 0 specimen, but still quite long (Fig. 3f-g). The following posterior pleural spines are long also in the remaining three released segments and apparently also in the following unreleased ones. This is in contrast with the adult condition, in which the most anterior segment has a tiny posterior pleural spine. Spines then become progressively longer posteriorly in the thorax. There is thus during ontogeny a relative shortening of the posterior pleural spines in the anterior segments. In the adult, the anterior segments are more modified (apomorphic) than the posterior, the latter being more primitive (plesiomorphic), and closer to the ancestral condition.
