        	TEXT CHARACTER=1 TEXT='Description from Strait et al., (1997): ^n"Hominids vary in the pattern by which the nasal bones project above the frontomaxillary suture (Olson, 1985; Eckhardt, 1987; Walker & Leakey, 1988). Four states are recognized: (0) nasal bones extend superior to the frontomaxillary suture by means of a narrow projection (i.e., the nasal bones taper above the suture line); (1) nasal bones project above the frontomaxillary suture, widening laterally as they pass the suture line; (2) nasal bones do not project above the frontomaxillary suture; and (3) variable. The final state is observed in A. africanus. The nasals project and are expanded in Taung but they project and are superiorly tapered in Stw 505 and Sts 5. Whereas Olson (1985) suggested that the nasal bones do not project in Sts 5, Broom & Robinson (1950) have noted that they do in fact project above the suture. Pan and Gorilla are coded as having nasals that project and taper. Although Eckhardt (1987) observed morphological variants in 8% of ape crania, the dominant pattern in both genera is state 0. Our own observations confirm this. This character is treated as unordered because there seems to be an equal probability of deriving each state from any other. ^nThis character combines S&M 1 (nasion approaches glabella) and S&M 2 (location of greatest width of nasal bones). When nasion approaches glabella, the nasal bones project, but it is necessary to combine S&M 1 and S&M 2 because it is uncertain whether projecting nasal bones are homologous when the manner in which they project differs (i.e., tapered vs. expanded). Furthermore, the frontomaxillary suture is a better reference point than glabella for assessing nasal bone projection because nasion may approach glabella because of either the superior movement of nasion or the inferior migration of glabella (Clarke, 1977)."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=2 TEXT='Description from Strait et al., (1997): ^n"Olson (1985) describes the morphology of the inferior margin of the orbit as being either rounded laterally or not rounded. Rounded lateral margins are present in A. aethiopicus and A. robustus. They are also present in a large proportion of male G. gorilla, and thus this species is coded as being variable. This character is equivalent to S&M 3."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"This character is equivalent to S&M 4. However, the character is here quantified as a ratio of the distances between orbitale and the foramen, and orbitale and the root of the zygoma. A high foramen has a value of 0.5 (within the lower half). State assignments produced by this ratio corespond to those of S&M 4 except with respect to A. africanus. This is because Sts 52a possesses a low foramen whereas the foramina in all other A. africanus specimens are high. Accordingly, A. africanus is here coded as being variable. Although Skelton & McHenry (1992) noted that Sts 52a has a low foramen, they coded the species as "high". "^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine (2004): ^n"KGA 10-525 has a high infraorbital foramen (Suwa et al., 1997), whereas all other P. boisei crania have an infraorbital foramen that pierces the lower half of the chord measured between orbitale and the root of the zygoma. Thus, this species is considered variable."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"This character is equivalent to S&M 6, but state assignments here differ considerably from theirs. Skelton & McHenry (1992) followed Rak (1983) in accepting that pillars in A. boisei (and, by extension, A. aethiopicus) had been "obscured by infilling". This state assignment is based on a functional interpretation of australopithecine facial evolution (Rak, 1983), rather than upon strict observation. Consequently, pillars are considered to be absent in A. boisei and A. aethiopicus. Furthermore, pillars are variable in A. africanus rather than present (contra S&M 6) because they are absent in Sts 52a but present in all other relevant specimens. Finally, contrary to S&M 6, pillars are considered to be variable in H. habilis (present in Stw 53, OH 62, KNM-ER 1805; absent in KNM-ER 1813, SK 847), and absent in H. rudolfensis (KNM-ER 1470)."^n^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine (2004): ^n"Keyser (2000: table 2) described the Drimolen skull as lacking anterior pillars. However, in the text of the paper, he (Keyser, 2000: 189) stated that "Weakly developed anterior pillars are barely visible." Moreover, he noted that the margins of the nasal aperture are rounded. Thus, we interpret this specimen as having anterior pillars, albeit ones that are weak."^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"This character is equivalent to S&M 12. Rak (1983) describes three forms of the nasoalveolar clivus: convex, straight, and concave (=nasoalveolar "gutter"). In our definition, "straight" includes both slight concavity and slight convexity. Skelton & McHenry (1992) considered the clivus of A. aethiopicus (KNM-WT 17000) to be more concave than that in A. robustus and A. boisei. All three of these species are coded here as being concave. Furthermore (contra S&M 12), H. habilis possesses a straight clivus."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"When the nasoalveolar contour protrudes, the incisors are anterior to the canines, and when there is no protrusion, the incisors are in the same coronal plane as the canines. Skelton & McHenry (1992) stated that Stw 73 lacks protrusion, and thus coded A. africanus as variable. We disagree with this assessment, and consider protrusion to be present in this and all other A. africanus specimens." ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=7 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"This character seems to be equivalent to S&M 10 ("distinct subnasal and intranasal components of nasoalveolar clivus"). McCollum et al. (1993) described differences in the form of the entrance to the nasal cavity in fossil hominids. A stepped entrance (state 0) is one in which there is a drop posterior to the nasoalveolar clivus. A smooth entrance is one in which the clivus grades into the nasal floor. However, a smooth entrance can be formed in two (presumably non-homologous) ways. In H. sapiens, the smooth entrance is formed by flexions in the clivus and hard palate, which do not overlap (state 3). In other hominid species that exhibit a smooth entrance, the clivus and palate ovelap considerably (state 2). State assignments follow McCollum et al. (1993: p. 97, Table 7), who differ from Skelton & McHenry (1992) regarding A. africanus, A. robustus, and A. boisei. McCollum et al. (1993) also differ from Walker et al. (1986), who characterized A. africanus as being intermediate. Furthermore, McCollum et al. (1993) characterized KNM-ER 1805 as having a smooth nasal cavity entrance, whereas Skelton and McHenry (1992) stated that it is stepped. According to McCollum et al. (1993), H. habilis is variable (state 1; smooth in Stw 53, OH 62, KNM-ER 1805; stepped in KNM-ER 1813, OH 24, SK 847)."^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine (2004): ^n"This character refers to both the contour of the nasal cavity entrance and the degree to which the nasoalveolar clivus and palatine processes overlap. Strait et al. (1997) obtained their states for this character from McCollum et al. (1993). McCollum subsequently updated her characterizations of certain early hominid specimens (McCollum, 2000), and morphological groupings proposed by her are largely adopted here. Note that McCollum (2000) also recognized a distinction between Pan and Gorilla regarding the magnitude of vertical relief between the premaxilla and maxillary palatine processes. This distinction is not recognized here because of the possibility that the difference is a scaling phenomenon."^n^nModification by Mongle, Strait, and Grine: ^nSG7 (Nasal cavity entrance) is now coded as variable (4) for Au. afarensis based on figure 5.22 in Kimbel et al. (2004) which depicts AL 442-1 as stepped with no overlap. We also note that Haile-Selassie et al. (2015) describe 442-1 as stepped with no overlap. This state was previously stepped with overlap (0). This is a new state for SG7. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=8 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"McCollum et al. (1993: Tables 4 and 5) recorded palatal thickness posterior to the incisive fossa for a variety of extant and extinct hominoids. A palate thicker than 7 mm is found only in "robust" australopithecines. All other hominids have a thin palate (';
	TEXT CHARACTER=9 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"Kimbel et al. (1984) measured this character as an index of zygomaticoalveolar height relative to orbitoalveolar height. With the exception of OH 5, all specimens of A. africanus, A. robustus and A. boisei had index values in excess of 56.4. All specimens of A. afarensis, H. habilis, H. rudolfensis and H. sapiens fall below 56.6. All Pan specimens were found to fall below 60, as did all but one Gorilla specimen (Kimbel, pers. comm.). Excluding the single Gorilla outlier, the range for that species is 42.2-58.5. Thus, two states are recognized with slightly overlapping ranges: state 0, a high masseter origin, with an index value in excess of 56, and state 1, a low origin, with an index value below 60. OH 5 has an index value of 47.9. Kimbel et al. (1984: footnote to Table 5) attribute this to its extraordinary facial height, and thus still consider A. boisei to have a high masseter origin.^nThis character is redundant with S&M 15 (zygomaticoalveolar crest weakly arched in frontal view). This feature was first described by Rak (1983), but Kimbel et al. (1984: p. 349) poined out that the form of the crest is a necessary correlate of masseter height, and they (1984: p. 375) recognized these features as a single character."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=10 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"Two states are recognized: (0) thin, with a thickness of less than 8 mm; and (1) thick (>8 mm). Zygomatic thickness does not simply reflect body size, because the zygomae are thin in both male and female Gorilla.^nThis character replaces S&M 13 ("robusticity of zygomatic bone"). Robusticity is usually measured as an index of breadth to height, but this did not reveal any clear taxonomic groupings among fossil hominids or African apes."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=11 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"This character describes the "dishing" of the face and is equivalent to S&M 16, although they did not indicate the point of reference for their characterizations. By using the piriform aperture as a reference, three distinct morphologies are recognized: the infra-orbial plate of the zygoma is posterior to the aperture (state 0), the zygoma is at the level of the aperture (state 2), and the zygoma is anterior to the aperture. State 3 is equivalent to having a dished face. A. africanus is variable (state 1) because Sts 71 exhibits the intermediate morphology (state 2), whereas all other specimens of that species have posteriorly positioned zygomatics."^n^nModifications by Mongle, Strait, and Grine: ^n"Following examination of the DNH 7 cranium, we revise two character states for Paranthropus robustus. Although the height of the masseter origin (SG 9) had been coded before as high (state 2) for P. robustus, the masseter origin is low in DNH 7. Therefore, P. robustus is now coded as exhibiting state 1 (variable) in this character. The anterior projection of the zygomatic bone relative to the piriform aperture (SG 11; "-''dishing"--) in DNH 7 also requires a change to the state coded by Strait and Grine (2004). While P. robustus was considered dished in prior analyses (previously state 3), we now regard DNH 7 to exhibit more intermediate zygomatic morphology. As such, P. robustus is coded as a new variable state (state 3, variable intermediate-anterior; anterior/dished now becomes state 4)."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=12 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"This character is equivalent to S&M 43. Two morphologies are recognized: shallow, in which the palate grades posteriorly from the base of the incisors as a flat surface or in which there is a slight depression anterior to the incisive foramen (state 0), and deep (i.e., shelved), in which the palate rises sharply vertically before turning posteriorly at the incisive foramen (state 2). H. habilis is variable (state 1; shallow in KNM-ER 1813 and OH 24; deep in OH 62, Stw 53, SK 847). S&M 43 considered both of these taxa to be deep. A preponderance of humans have deep palates (DeVilliers, 1968)."^n^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine (2004): ^nThe palates of KGA 10-525 and KGA 10-506 are shallow anteriorly (Suwa et al., 1997), whereas all other P. boisei crania possess an anteriorly deep palate. Thus, this species is considered variable."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=13 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"Rak (1983) used this measurement to describe the proportion of the palate that is found anterior to sellion. It is essentially a measure of facial prognathism. Based on Rak (1983: Table 3), Kimbel & White (1988: p. 185), and measurements by the authors, three morphologies are recognized: prognathic (index >57; state 0), mesognathic (index between 57 and 30; state 2), and orthognathic (index ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=14 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"Rak''s (1983, 1988) index of masseteric position describes the anterior migration of the masseter muscle. An index value of 100 indicates that the masseteric tubercle is in the same coronal plane as sellion. Two states are recognized: (0) the tubercle is at or posterior to sellion (index values less than or equal to 105), and (1) it is at or anterior to sellion (index values less than or equal to 95). The ranges of these two states overlap partially.^nThis character is not redundant with character 11 (anterior projection of zygomatic), since the former describes the placement of a muscle attachment whereas the latter describes a bony structure. However, S&M 45 ("index of overlap") and S&M 47 ("index of palate protrusion anterior to masseter") are measurements developed by Rak (1983) that incorporate the same information presented in this character and character 13 (index of palate protrusion). Consequently, S&M 45 and 47 are not used."^n^n^nModification by Mongle, Strait, and Grine: ^n (Masseteric position relative to sellion) is now coded as variable (1) for Au. africanus based on: Sts 5 is slightly anterior (at), Sts 71 is well anterior, and Sts 52 is posterior. This was previously coded as "-?at or posterior"-? (0).  States for this character have changed because we now employ an index (>95/';
	TEXT CHARACTER=15 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"According to Rak (1983: pp. 32-33), this is a gutter-like triangular depression in the infraorbital region. He identified it in A. robustus, and it is also present in KNM-WT 17000."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=16 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"The cube root of cranial capacity was used so as to counteract the exponential growth of this volume in relation to the linear dimensions of the braincase. However, equivalent groupings were found using the volumetric measurement, and this is presented here because readers are more familiar with the manner in which this measurement is distributed in hominids. Five states are recognized (data from Aiello & Dean, 1990; Tobias, 1991; Brown et al., 1993), some of which overlap considerably: (0) below 500 cm3, (1) approximately 500 cm3, (2) 509-680 cm3, (3) 750-875 cm3, (4) approximately 1400 cm3. State 0 includes P. troglodytes, G. gorilla, A. afarensis and A. aethiopicus. Although some gorillas may exceed 500 cm3, their body sizes are also much greater, and thus their brains are relatively quite small. State 1 includes A. africanus, A. robustus, and A. boisei. Stw 505 has considerably extended the range of A. africanus (Clarke, pers. comm.). State 2 includes H. habilis. Although the range of H. habilis overlaps considerably with those of australopithecines, the smallest H. habilis cranial capacity (KNM-ER 1813: 509 cm3) is still much larger than the smallest representatives of the australopithecine species. Holloway (1973) estimated the cranial capacity of Sts 19 to be 436 cm3, but reconstructions that include the calotte Sts 58 indicate cranial capacities between 530 and 570 cm3 (Broom & Robinson, 1948; Tobias, 1975). State 3 includes H. rudolfensis and H. ergaster. State 4 includes H. sapiens. In general, S&M 65 recognized finer distinctions between taxa than are recognized here."^n^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine (2004): ^n"The state assignments of several early hominid taxa have been revised from Strait et al. (1997). Recent discoveries have made clear that the australopith species overlap extensively with re- spect to brain size. Regarding Pr. afarensis, A.L. 444-2 has an estimated capacity of 500 cc (Holloway and Yuan, 2004), which increases the range of this species. With reference to P. boisei, we include here Holloway''""?s (1988) rough estimate of 395 cc for KNM-WT 17400, which is notably smaller than the values for other P. boisei specimens. The range for this species sample has been extended also by Suwa et al. (1997), who provided an estimate of 545 cc for KGA 10-525. We have excluded KNM-ER 3733 from the H. ergaster sample because its published estimate is a minimum value, and we have utilized the "age corrected" value of 909 cc provided for KNM-WT 15000 (Begun and Walker, 1993). Although not formally considered here, the specimens from Dmanisi that are likely to be conspecific with the African H. ergaster sample suggest that the range in brain size in this species extends below the size observed in the Nariokotome specimen. The ranges of the non-Homo samples overlap extensively, and they overlap with the ranges for the African ape samples. Because there is no clear distinction among these various species, they are all provided with the same character state."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=17 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"Holloway (1988) stated that in Homo, A. boisei and A. robustus, the cerebellum is tucked underneath the cerebrum. In most other hominids, the cerebellum flares laterally and protrudes posteriorly. Holloway did not discuss A. afarensis, but our observations suggest that it too flares laterally with posterior protrusion. This character is equivalent to S&M 66."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=18 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"Although Kimbel (1984) argued that this character is sufficiently variable in humans to preclude its use in phylogenetic studies, it nonetheless appears to discriminate between hominid taxa. An O-M sinus is present either uni- or bilaterally in high frequency (state 2) in A. afarensis, A. boisei, and A. robustus (Falk, 1986, 1988, 1990). It is absent or found in low frequency (state 0) in African apes (Kimbel, 1984), H. habilis (Tobias, 1991), H. rudolfensis (Kimbel, 1984; Tobias, 1991). It is absent in the juvenile A. aethiopicus L. 338 y-6 (Rak & Howell, 1978; Walker & Leakey, 1988), and while Walker et al. (1986) inferred that it is present in KNM-WT 17000 because of a reduced transverse sinus, Holloway (1988) has disputed this. An O-M sinus is present in 25% of A. africanus specimens. It is absent in MLD 37/38 (Conroy et al., 1990), MLD 1, Sts 5, Sts 26, TM 1511, and Sts 71 (Kimbel, 1984), and present in Taung (Tobias & Falk, 1988) and one Stw specimen (Kimbel, pers. comm.). Between 8 and 46% of modern humans exhibit and O-M sinus (Kimbel, 1984). Accordingly, A. africanus and Homo sapiens are coded as having an intermediate frequency (state 1)."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=19 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"This character, as defined by Kimbel (1988; see also Clarke, 1977; Rak, 1983), describes the course of the superior temporal line between frontomalaretemporale and the point of maximum inflection on the line as it turns from being medially directed to posteriorly directed. Incursion is best seen in superior view. Incursion is strong in the "robust" australopithecines, where the temporal line penetrates far medially and is parallel to the orbital margin. Incursion is weak in H. ergaster, H. rudolfensis and H. sapiens, where the line barely penetrates medially and is strongly oblique to the orbital margin. H. habilis is variable, because incursion is weak in OH 24 and KNM-ER 1813, but moderate in SK 847 and Stw 53. Data for A. afarensis comes from KNM-ER 2602 and the Belohdeli frontal (Kimbel, 1988; Asfaw, 1987).^nIncursion is related to, but not entirely redundant with the presence/absence of a sagittal crest (character 20). For example, both G. gorilla and "robust" australopithecines have a sagittal crest, but these taxa differ in their degree of incursion. However, S&M 69 ("supraorbital tori in form of costa supraorbitalis") and S&M 70 ("temporal lines converge anterior to bregma") are redundant with this character. With respect to S&M 69, Clarke (1977) describes the supraorbital tori of Pongo, A. boisei and A. robustus as "rib-like" because they are flattened superiorly and have a sharp posterior margin. He notes, however, that the development of the rib is related to postorbital constriction (character 26) and the incursion of the temporal lines, both of which are used here. S&M 70 ("temporal lines converge anterior to bregma") is also redundant with incursion and the presence/absence of a sagittal crest."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=20 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"A sagittal crest is present in KNM-ER 1805 and Stw 505 (Clarke, pers. comm.). Consequently, a sagittal crest is present in all hominid species except H. rudolfensis, H. ergaster and H. sapiens. S&M 71 recognized that a crest is present in KNM-ER 1805, but coded Homo as lacking this feature."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=21 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"Following Kimbel (1988), three states are recognized: (0) an extensive crest extending almost the entire distance between inion and the lateral margin of the supramastoid crest, (1) a partial crest confined to the lateral third of the bi-asterioric breadth, and (2) a crest is absent. A. robustus is coded as missing data for this character. Although Robinson (1958) reported that crests were absent in SK 48, SK 49 and SK 83, the nuchal region is missing in SK 48 and SK 83, and SK 49 is not a definitive male. Even though crests are absent in SK 47, this specimen is a juvenile, and may not be ontogenetically old enough to exhibit a crest. The H. habilis state assignment is based on KNM-ER 1805.^nS&M 72 ("size of posterior relative to anterior part of temporalis muscle") is rejected because it represents an interpretation of morphology rather than an observation, and because that interpretation is based on patterns of cranial cresting, which have already been accepted as characters in this analysis. Thus, S&M 72 is redundant with this character and character 20 (presence of sagittal crest). For instance, a sagittal crest combined with a partial temporal nuchal crest would indicate a large anterior temporalis."^n^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine (2004): ^n"It appears that KGA 10-525 possesses an extensive temporonuchal (TN) crest that runs nearly from inion to the lateral margin of the supramastoid crest (Suwa et al., 1997: fig. 2). An extensive crest is lacking in other presumptive male P. boisei crania. Paranthropus boisei is therefore recognized as being variable in this character."';

H. habilis is correspondingly coded as being variable. Skelton & McHenry (1992) noted the condition of KNM-ER 1805, but considered a notch to be absent in Homo. Walker et al. (1986) and Kimbel et al. (1988) state that a notch is probably present in KNM-WT 17000. Although a notch is absent in L. 338 y-6, a putative juvenile A. aethiopicus, Kimbel & Rak (1985) note that the character is absent in juvenile apes. All other taxa lack an asterionic notch."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=23 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"Kimbel & Rak (1985) describe a morphology present in male A. boisei in which the external tables of the temporal, parietal and occipital bones overlap in a complex "sandwich" pattern at asterion. This pattern is also present in KNM-WT 17000 (Kimbel et al., 1988), and incipiently in L. 338 y-6. S&M 73 describes this character as "temporoparietal overlap of occipital". The name is shortened here to "parietal overlap of occipital" because the relationship between the temporal and parietal bones is subsumed within character 24 (squamosal suture overlap extensive). Thus, this character refers only to the flange of parietal bone that extends posteroinferiorly over the occipital."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=24 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"This character refers in particular to the superior and posterosuperior aspects of the squamosal suture. Rak (1978; see also 1983; Kimbel & Rak, 1985) noted that the squamosal suture of A. boisei is extensive, tapered with a bevel (sutura limbosa), and possesses numerous inter- digitations. L.338y-6 also has an extensive squamosal suture (Rak & Howell, 1978). KNM-WT 17000 has an extensive suture, though there is disagreement concerning its morphology. Rak & Kimbel (1991, 1993) consider the specimen to have a unique posterolateral extension of the suture, which is disputed by Walker et al. (1993). We follow the latter in the interpretation of KNM-WT 17000. Squamosal suture morphology is poorly preserved in adult A. robustus, so that species cannot be characterized. All other species lack an extensive suture."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=25 TEXT='Description from Strait et al.

In contrast, A. robustus, H. habilis and H. rudolfensis are here assigned to the intermediate category. H. ergaster is variable, because the fossa of KNM-ER 3883 is of intermediate depth while those of KNM-ER 3773 and KNM-WT 15000 are shallow. These taxa are usually all considered to have deep fossae, but index values do not support such state assignments. Furthermore, of all the species examined, only H. sapiens and A. boisei possess an articular eminence whose posterior face is so steeply inclined as to be nearly vertical. This undoubtedly accounts for the fact that they have larger index values than any other species. Wood (1993) states that H. habilis has a deeper fossa than H. rudolfensis, but we characterize both as intermediate. The discrepancy between our state assignments and those of others may rest in the fact that our measurement is one of relative depth. The fossae of A. robustus and early Homo may be as absolutely deep as in H. sapiens, but only those of A. boisei are relatively as deep.

In addition, Wood (1992) has noted that H. rudolfensis specimens do not exhibit M3 reduction, in comparison to H. habilis specimens. Thus, we are reasonably confident in our assignment of a character state to H. rudolfensis as being equivalent to A. africanus and P. robustus, and larger than H. habilis.^nA. aethiopicus is accepted as having large molar teeth. Although there is no complete crown associated with KNM-WT 17000, it has very large tooth roots (cf. OH 5), and while there is no M3 that has been definitely attributed to A. aethiopicus, the roots and alveoli of Omo 57.4-1968-41 indicate the presence of three large molars. This, together with the KNM-WT 16005 crowns provide for a reasonably confident assignment of overall molar crown size."^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=55 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"This character replaces S&M 29 ("distal crown profile of dm1") which was taken from White et al. (1981). Grine (1984) has demostrated that because of its intraspecific polymorphism, the distal crown profile of the dm1 fails to distinguish adequately between taxa. The mesial crown profile, on the other hand, is a feature that has been shown to differ between species, and to exhibit a low degree of variability within OTUs (Robinson, 1954; Grine, 1984, 1985).^nThis character comprises several inter-related traits, which were atomized by Grine (1985). These are: (a) the position of the protoconid relative to the metaconid, (b) the disposition of the mesial marginal ridge, and (c) the structure of the fovea anterior. Three states are recognized: (0) there is virtually no mesial marginal ridge present, the protoconid is situated well mesial, and the anterior fovea exhibits a wide lingual opening, (1) the mesial marginal ridge is slight, the protoconid is situated mesial of metaconid, the fovea anterior opens lingually via a fissure between the mesial marginal ridge and metaconid, (2) the mesial marginal ridge is well- developed and horizontally disposed, the protoconid is nearly level with metaconid, and the anterior fovea is enclosed lingually.^nInformation for H. habilis and H. rudolfensis is lacking because no dm1 is definitively attributable to either, because we accept that the KNM-ER 820 and KNM-ER 1507 likely represent H. ergaster. Omo 222-2744 is a very early specimen of Homo (Grine, 1984), but its specific attribution is unresolved. The datum for A. aethiopicus is based on L.704-2 from Member D."';

Data are not available for H. ergaster or A. aethiopicus because no dm2 is definitively attributable to either species.^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine (2004): This character describes the positions of the buccal and lingual cusp tips relative to the crown base, whereas Strait et al.

The buccal and lingual crown faces are nearly vertical. (1) = cusp tips widely separated; lingual cusps approximate lingual crown margin, which is nearly vertical; buccal cusps tips placed slightly lingual to buccal crown margin, which is slightly to moderately bulbous.

The condition exhibited by the P4 applies equally to the P3, the lower premolars, and the upper and lower molars. This character reflects the postion of the cusp tips being nearer the crown margin in occlusal view, or closer to the crown center (Clarke, 1977; Tobias, 1991; Grine & Strait, 1994). Three states are recognized: (0) apices widely separated and approximate the outer crown margins, (2) apices are close together, and (1) a condition intermediate between the first two.

	TEXT CHARACTER=58 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"This feature is a slight alteration of S&M 32. Their characterization of this character, and therefore the character state distributions that they recognized are altered. We refer to the frequency of a well-developed P3 metaconid within each species sample. Three states are recognized, being (0) metaconid absent, (1) metaconid infrequent, and (2) metaconid frequent.^nIn addition to S&M 32, Skelton & McHenry (1992) employed four other characters that reflect P3 metaconid development. S&M 33 ("P3 talonid height") is clearly related to the size of the metaconid, and indeed, the codes that they provide for these "two" features (S&M 32 and 33) have exactly the same distributions. S&M 34 ("robust" features of P3) is not a single character, but a compilation of several components, which are related to the overall size of the crown, the size of the metaconid, and talonid development. This morphology has been accommodated in the present study by characters 53 and 58. S&M 35 ("crown shape index of P3") is related to metaconid development, because a large metaconid will result in lingual expansion of the crown and, therefore, an increased BL diameter. Also, because the P3s in Pan, Gorilla, and A. afarensis are set at an angle to the tooth row, their MD and BL diameters are not strictly comparable with those recorded for the premolars of other species (White et al., 1981). Finally, S&M 35 is little more than a metrical statement of S&M 36 ("P3 occlusal outline shape")."';

	TEXT CHARACTER=60 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. (1997): ^n"Dean (1985, 1987, 1988b) and Smith (1986, 1994) have described differences in the calcification and eruption patterns of the permanent teeth in extant hominoids and fossil hominids. The results of their independent investigations are in broad agreement with regard to general patterns of development in that A. afarensis and A. africanus are observed to display a pattern consistent with that exhibited by Pan and Gorilla. This pattern (state 0) entails delayed maturation of the permanent incisors, premolars and especially the canines relative to the development of the M1. Humans display a condition (state 1) in which there is greater concordance of developmental timing among these teeth. Although Smith (1986) expressed some doubt as to the pattern that best described KNM-ER 820 and KNM-ER 1507 (attributed here to H. ergaster), Dean (1987, 1988b) and later Smith (1994) considered their incisor and molar patterns to be comparable to those of modern humans. Dean (1988b; Dean et al., 1993) and Smith (1986, 1994) are in agreement that A. robustus and A. boisei display a pattern of dental development in which their incisors, canines and premolars are developmen- tally advanced relative to the M1 by human standards (state 2). According to Smith (1988, 1994), KNM-ER 1590, attributed here to H. rudolfensis, exhibits the primitive ape-like pattern (state 0). Data are unavailable for A. aethiopicus and for H. habilis. The specific attribution of the early Homo juvenile mandible Omo 222-2744 is uncertain, as is that (SKX 21204) from Swartkrans Member 1 "Lower Bank" (Grine, 1993); in neither case has the specimen been examined in relation to this question."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=61 TEXT='Description from Strait and Grine 2004: ^n"This feature relates to both the upper and lower P3. Together with P3 metaconid development, it relates to the overall asymmetry of the crown. In the study by Strait et al. (1997), the P3 occlusal outline was omitted as a character because it was judged to be a poor discriminator of hominid species. While the occlusal outline per se displays considerable intraspecific variability, the degree of asymmetry of the crown base appears to differentiate certain taxa (White et al., 1994; Leakey et al., 1995). That is, the tuberculum premolare may be developed, resulting in a mesiobuccal protrusion of the crown base. This may result in an asymmetrical crown profile. The degree of symmetry, then, is scored as the mesiobuccal protrusion of the crown base being strong (state 0), moderate (state 1), variable (state 2), or weak to absent (state 3). Unlike the development of the transverse ridge, and the development and mesial enclosure of the fovea anterior, the development of the mesiobuccal flange (= tuberculum premolare) of the P3 is not related directly to the size and disposition of the metaconid.^nBecause the degree of mesiobuccal protrusion of the P3 crown base serves to differentiate taxa, it has been added to the phylogenetic character matrix. In their description of Australopithecus garhi, Asfaw et al. (1999a: table 1) referred to the "UP3 occlusal outline" and the "UP3 mesiobuccal line extension" as separate features. We consider these features to be related, as the mesiobuccal line extension refers to the cervical convexity of the tuberculum premolare, and the occlusal outline is affected by its development. In their initial analysis of the characters iterated by Asfaw et al. (1999a), as pertaining to A. garhi, Strait and Grine (1999) conflated them and simply referred to the character as number 61 and employed the name "UP3 occlusal outline" because it was used by Asfaw et al. (1999a) and is commonly employed, even though the specific feature of interest pertains to the mesiobuccal protrusion of the crown base (=tuberculum premolare). This choice of name led McCollum (1999b) to criticize Strait and Grine (1999) for apparently including a character that had been previously excluded (Strait et al., 1997). We clarify here that the manner in which the character was assessed differed in the two studies. To avoid further confusion, we refer here to the development of the tuberculum premolare as the mesiobuccal protrusion of the crown base.^nIn the diagnosis of Ar. ramidus, White et al. (1994: 306) stated that compared to other hominids, the "P3 [is] more strongly asymmetrical.. with posterolingually divided transverse crest." In addition, they noted (1994: 308) the "P3 is markedly more apelike than any A. afarensis homologue in its high protoconid with extensive buccal face and steep, distolingually directed transverse crest." White et al. (1994: 308) commented further that "the strong mesiobuccal protrusion of ARA-VP-6/ 1 crown base is also outside the known A. afarensis range,"but they noted that another specimen (ARA-VP-1/128) has a "weaker mesiobuccal protrusion of the crown base," which is similar to Pr. afarensis homologues. Ardipithecus ramidus is thus scored as being intermediate between Pan and Pr. afarensis in the asymmetry of its lower P3 crown.^nIn the description of A. anamensis, Leakey et al. (1995: 565) observed that it can be differentiated from Pr. afarensis on the basis that its "[lower] third premolar is very asymmetrical with a blunt, centrally positioned main cusp," and because its P3 has an "extensive sloping" buccal surface. This species is, therefore, scored as being intermediate between Pan and Pr. afarensis in the asymmetry of its P3 crown.^nIn their diagnosis of A. garhi, Asfaw et al. (1999a: table 1) noted that the upper P3 has a "more oval" occlusal outline, a derived state shared with Homo and A. africanus. They also observed that the "mesiobuccal line extension" is lacking.^nPraeanthropus afarensis is scored as variable in this feature on the basis of Leonard and Hegmon''s (1987) data and on observations of casts of all of the available (i.e., published) premolars. For example, LH 4 has a moderate degree of mesiobuccal protrusion of its lower P3, whereas A.L. 333w-60 exhibits weak mesiobuccal protrusion; the A.L. 266- 1 P3 is intermediate between these two extremes."';

The premolars may be angled to the molars, providing a parabolic arcade, or the entire postcanine tooth row may be divergent, providing a V-shaped arcade. Australopithecus anamensis has been described as having tooth rows that are parallel and close together (Leakey et al., 1995), and White et al.

Dean (1985: 48) noted that Australopithecus africanus (i.e., Sts 5, MLD 37/38) "appears to retain the long anteroposterior insertion of the longus capitis muscles seen in the great apes, "and that "prevertebral muscles in gracile australopithecines are still relatively large and apelike, markedly more so than in the "robust" australopithecines.

However, we now recognize more subtle distinctions in the morphology of this region which do not covary with facial hafting or supraorbital expression in hominin taxa. Supraorbital hollowing can be restricted to a midline delimited depression, restricted to a lateral depression (defined relative to the middle third of the orbit, as observed in KNM-ER 1470), or fully developed as a supratoral sulcus.

Therefore, P. robustus is now coded as exhibiting state 1 (variable) in this character. The anterior projection of the zygomatic bone relative to the piriform aperture (SG 11; “dishing”) in DNH 7 also requires a change to the state coded by Strait and Grine (2004). While P. robustus was considered dished in prior analyses (previously state 3), we now regard DNH 7 to exhibit more intermediate zygomatic morphology.
