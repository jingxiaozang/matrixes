        	TEXT CHARACTER=1 TEXT='Previously character 1 from Rothwell et al. (2005). Orthotropic growth indicates that the stem grows in a more or less vertical in orientation (as opposed to scrambling). Emporia cryptica and E. royalii were scored as (1), as Emporia spp. was treated by Rothwell et al. (2005). However, E. lockardii was scored as (?). Ernestiodendron was rescored from (1) to (?) due to lack of information. Genoites was rescored from (?) to (1) based on Cuneo (1985). Telemachus was scored as (?) by Escapa et al. (2010) and rescored as (1) based on Bomfleur et al. 2013. Dechellyia was scored as (1) based on Ash (1972).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=2 TEXT='Previously character 2 from Rothwell et al. (2005). Irregular/three dimensional: refers to lateral branch systems in which the leafy shoots are arranged three dimensionally or irregularly with respect to the direction of growth of the main axis. Plagiotropic refers to lateral branch systems in which the leafy shoots are arranged in one plane more or less perpendicular to the direction of growth of the main axis and are often more or less pinnately arranged. All three species of Emporia are scored as (1), as Emporia spp. was treated by Rothwell et al. (2005). Telemachus was scored as (?) by Escapa et al. (2010), and rescored as (0) based on Bomfleur et al. 2013. Dechellyia was scored as (1) based on Ash (1972).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='Previously characters 3 and 4 from Rothwell et al. (2005) now combined, stated differently and not attempting to discriminate different kinds of heterophylly. Heterophylly refers to pronounced differences in the shape of leaves, where two distinctive types of leaves are known (Hernandez-Castillo et al. 2009c). It may include position dependent, size dependent, and age dependent heterophylly (Hernandez-Castillo et al. 2009c). Dechellyia was scored as present (1) based on Ash (1972).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='Previously character 5 from Rothwell et al. (2005). Absent, refers to the development of a lateral shoot from a meristem not previously contained in a resting scaly bud. This type of branching, which results in the production of synleptic shoots, is common in plants with more or less continuous pattern of growth and is typical of many extinct Paleozoic conifers. Present, refers to the development of a lateral shoot from a meristem previously contained within a resting scaly bud. All three species of Emporia are scored (0), as Emporia spp. was treated by Rothwell et al. (2005). Dechellyia was scored as (?) based on Ash (1972).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='Previously character 7 from Rothwell et al. (2005). All three species of Emporia are scored as (0), as Emporia spp. was treated by Rothwell et al. (2005). Swedenborgia was scored as (?) by Escapa et al. (2010) and rescored as (1) based on Harris (1935) and Nosova et al. (2017). Krassilovia was scored as (?) by Herrera et al. (2015) and rescored as (1) based on the new evidence presented in this paper.
