        	TEXT CHARACTER=1 TEXT='Yang et al. 2015 char 1';
	TEXT CHARACTER=2 TEXT='Yang et al. 2015 char 2^nNumerous lobopodians have been considered to have cephalic sclerites (see ref. 65, character 37), but in some cases this interpretation requires revision or confirmation through new material. Following recent data presented by Liu and Dunlop (66), this character is scored absent in Hallucigenia fortis (contra ref. 67), Onychodictyon ferox (contra ref. 39) and Cardiodictyon (see ref. 67). An uncertain scoring is used where the anterior region is ambiguously preserved, such as in H. hongmeia (68). This character is scored as present in for the sclerotized structures observed in the head region of Luolishania (5) and the Emu Bay Shale Collins’ monster (ref. 3, fig. 1c), as the morphological similarity with Collinsium strengthens the likelihood that the cephalic sclerites represent a legitimate feature in the former taxon (contra ref. 3). Collinsium bears a pair of discrete subrectangular sclerites on the anterior region (Fig. 1). Taxa with an incomplete anterior region (e.g. Acinocricus, Hadranax, Orstenotubulus) are coded as uncertain. This character is coded as uncertain for the Burgess Shale Collins’ monster (2) as the only photograph of this taxon does not allow the presence of head sclerites to be distinguished.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='Yang et al. 2015 ch 3^nScored as (–) inapplicable if: head sclerites (Character 2) absent^nThis character is scored as absent for fuxianhuiids, because the cephalic shield is not derived from fused segments (1. 53, 56, 69), and in radiodontans, because the carapace-like structure on the head seems not to cover multiple cephalic segments (20, 70, 71, 72). This character is scored as absent in the Emu Bay Shale Collins’ monster based on the close morphological similarities with the anterior organization in Luolishania (5, 73) and Collinsium (Fig. 1).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='Yang et al. 2015 ch 4^nScored as (–) inapplicable if: head sclerites (Character 2) are absent^nThis character is scored as present in radiodontans because the dorsal carapace-like structure covering their heads is associated with eye-stalks, regardless of its shape or size (e.g. 20, 71, 72). Anterior sclerites are widespread among Paleozoic euarthropods including fuxianhuiids (1, 61), and artiopodans (57, 60). Recent palaeoneurological data support the homology of the dorsal carapace-like plate in Radiodonta with the anterior sclerite of upper-stem and crown-group Euarthropoda (74). This character is scored as absent in Collinsium and Luolishania (5) given that the isolated sclerites on the head region are not associated with stalked lateral eyes; an uncertain score is coded for the Emu Bay Shale Collins’ monster as it is not possible to discern the anterior organization of the only available specimen, despite the presence of a well-defined isolated sclerite (3).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='Pates, Wolfe et al. 2021 ch5^nThis character defines the anterior extension of the central carapace element of many hurdiids (Aegirocassis, Hurdia, Pahvantia) which is absent in Amplectobeluids and Anomalocaridids.';

Carapaces which taper to a point and/or bear an anterior spine are coded (1) (e.g. Aegirocassis, Hurdia) while those with a rounded anterior margin are coded as (0) (e.g. Cambroraster, Anomalocaris, Amplectobelua).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=7 TEXT='Pates, Wolfe et al. 2021 ch7.^nScored as (–) inapplicable if: isolated dorsal sclerite (Character 4) absent^nScored as (1) in taxa where the dorsal sclerite extends laterally significantly beyond covering the dorsal part of the head. This distinguishes the thin central carapace elements of hurdiids Hurdia victoria and Aegirocassis from the broad Cambroraster and Hurdia triangulata. As the carapace elements of Amplectobeluids and Anomalocaridids are not extended in any direction, this is coded as (0) absent for these taxa.^nFuxianhuiids also have dorsal sclerites which are extended significantly laterally and with a triangular taper, and so Fuxianhuia xiaoshibaensis and Chengjiangocaris are also coded as (1).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=8 TEXT='Lerosey-Aubril & Pates 2018 ch8^nThe central element of Pahvantia exhibits a strong postero-lateral constriction. A similar, but much less pronounced constriction is known in Hurdia triangulataand H. victoria(fig. 4in20, their ‘posterior notches’;  fig. 4  in19).  This  character  is  absent  in Aegirocassis or  any  other radiodonts with  anterior  sclerites,  as  well  as  in  deuteropods  with  anterior  sclerites  (e.g. Chengjiangocaris).^nAdditional note (SP): a pronounced constriction is also known in Cambroraster falcatus (lateral notch, Moysiuk & Caron 2019, fig. 1)';

A pair of much smaller lateral sclerites occurs in Amplectobelua symbrachiata8 and Lyrarapax unguispinus25,29.

	TEXT CHARACTER=15 TEXT='Yang et al. 2015 ch 8^nScored as inapplicable if: paired appendages (Character 1) absent^nSchinderhannes (19) is coded as having lobopodous post-protocerebral appendages based on the presence of a pair of enlarged lateral body flaps resembling those of the recently described radiodontan Lyrarapax (20). Although Liu et al. (76) described the appendages of the lobopodian Diania as having an arthropodized organization, a recent revision of this taxon by Ma et al. (65) concluded that the podomere-like structures on the legs are the result of taphonomic artifacts during burial; Diania is thus scored as having lobopodous appendages.';

	TEXT CHARACTER=21 TEXT='Yang et al. 2015 ch 14^nScored as (–) inapplicable if: paired appendages (ch 1) absent^nThere are various taxa in which the deutocerebral appendage pair is morphologically differentiated from the rest of the trunk appendages (see references in ref. 66). For example, Antennacanthopodia has a second set of antenna-like limbs that are morphologically distinct from the walking legs (82). Although the deutocerebral appendage in Collinsium and other Luolishaniidae is morphologically specialized (2–5), this is expressed on the anterior five or six legs; consequently, this character is scored as absent given that the deutocerebral limb pair is not uniquely differentiated relative to other trunk appendages. Daley and Edgecombe (71) redescribed Anomalocaris canadensis and reported the presence of a smaller set of flaps in proximity with the putative head region; given that this differentiation is expressed in size, rather than structural identity, the deutocerebral limbs are scored as undifferentiated in Anomalocaris. This character is scored as uncertain for Schinderhannes (21) as the preservation does not allow identifying the occurrence of limbs on the anterior region. The first pair of legs in Tardigrada is serially homologous with the deutocerebral segment of Euarthropoda (35), and thus is not structurally different from the rest of the trunk appendages. The deutocerebral jaws of Onychophora are significantly modified relative to the rest of the appendages in the body (25, 32). In Euarthropoda, this morphological differentiation is generally expressed in the presence of an antenniform (1, 57, 62) or raptorial (52, 55, 63) deutocerebral appendage.

The mouth opening is ventrally oriented in Pambdelurion (49), radiodontans (71, 72), Onychophora and Heterotardigrada (26, 32, 35, 39, 95); it faces posteriad in Opabinia (79) and upper stem-group euarthropods (1, 55, 57, 70). The mouth is orientated ventrally in Collinsium, as evinced by the distinctive curvature of the head region and the trace of the anterior parts of the gut. A similar organization is observed in other lobopodians, including Hallucigenia sparsa, H. fortis (84, 67), Microdictyon (96), and Luolishania (5). Murdock et al. (97) have recently recommended that the orientation of the mouth should be interpreted with caution in fossil lobopodians based on decay experiments of extant onychophorans. With this consideration, the mouth orientation has been scored as ventral (state 1) in those taxa in which there is direct evidence of mouth orientation in combination with a well-preserved gut, as Murdock et al. (ref. 97, p. 6) concede that the preservation of more labile structures is a good indicator of limited decay and thus authentic biological signal.

Although the preservation of Jianshanopodia (91, 92) and Megadictyon (90) obscures the most proximal morphology of the frontal appendages, there is no indication that the body wall extends beyond the bases of these limbs and the mouth; thus the presence of additional anterior limb pairs is highly unlikely.

Recent data on the morphogenesis of the onychophoran lip papillae, however, indicate that the latter structures have a complex developmental patterning, and receive nervous terminals from the dorsal part of the brain associated with the anteriormost three-segments of the body (26, 33); thus, the onychophoran papillae do not reflect the symplesiomorphic organization of the anterior region as observed in cycloneuralians (99–102). Given that there is no evidence that the scalids of Priapulida and the oral lamellae of Tardigrada have a similarly complex morphogenetic origin, and that it is impossible to discern whether the circumoral structures of Paleozoic lobopodians and radiodontans are analogous to the onychophoran papillae, these structures are scored as potentially homologous based on their distinctly radially symmetric arrangement around the mouth opening. Onychophorans differ considerably on this regard, as the lip papillae are circumoral but have a fundamentally bilaterally symmetrical organization (26, 33); thus this character is scored as absent.

The presence of median commissures has been recently demonstrated in Tardigrada (16, 19, 28) and thus suggests that the possession of ganglia and transverse commissures represent fundamentally linked neurological features (45). Priapulida have an unpaired nerve cord associated with a net-like system of neural connectives (31), and thus this character is scored as absent.

The lobopodian P. inermis has been described as possessing condensed ganglia (45). Given that the veracity of these observations has yet to be confirmed by additional study of the material, this character is treated as uncertain in the main analysis (Fig. S6). However, Yang et al. 2016 explored the potential implications of putative ganglia in P. inermis by running a second set of analyses that scored this character as present.

The nervous system of Tardigrada also displays dorsal and lateral longitudinal nerves that are intersected by transverse peripheral nerves (16, 18, 38, 43), although these organisms lack complete ring commissures (see character 124).
