        [Character comments]
        	TEXT CHARACTER=1 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The shape of the tympanic bulla has been used to distinguish various clades of mysticetes (see Tomilin, 1957; Oishi and Hasegawa, 1994), and bulla shape has been used in phylogenetic analyses (e.g., Steeman, 2007, who described the ''rhomboid'' state used here as "box shaped and elongate" [character 49, p. 892]; Geisler and Sanders, 2003, who described the shape as "narrow and long" versus "wide" [character 251, p. 120]).  In the plesiomorphic state, the tympanic bulla is ovoid and kidney-shaped, where the medial border curves continuously in ventral view.  In the apomorphic state, the anterior edge of the main ridge has a steeper slope, giving the anterior region of the bulla a flattened appearance in ventral view with a distinct anteromedial corner. The breadth of the anteromedial expansion of the bulla that forms the anteromedial corner appears to increase with ontogenetic age (personal observation), whereas more mature individuals tend to have a better developed anteromedial corner (although overall length of the bulla does not appear to increase with ontogenetic age in Balaenoptera acutorostrata, as reported by Oishi and Hasegawa, 1994, fig. 2).  The ''rhomboid'' condition also can be expressed as the maximum transverse width (perpendicular to the longitudinal axis) at the anterior end of the bulla, rather than posterior to, or at the level of, the sigmoid process.  ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The bulla is ovoid (plesiomorphic condition) in Eomysticetus whitmorei, Eschrichtius robustus, and all extant balaenopterids.  Balaenids and Caperea marginata are characterized by having the apomorphic rhomboid condition.  The anterior border of the bulla of Caperea indeed is flattened with an angle at the anteromedial corner, although it is not as well defined as in balaenids.  Nonetheless, we consider Caperea to possess the derived condition for the shape of the tympanic bulla. ^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was based on morphology described by Tomilin (1957), Kasuya (1973), and Oishi and Hasegawa (1994).  Additionally, the character was previously used in phylogenetic analyses by Geisler and Sanders (2003: character 251), Steeman (2007: characters 49 and 51) and Fitzgerald (2010: character 113).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=2 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: Dorsoventral compression of the medial half of the tympanic bulla was described by Geisler and Sanders (2003) as a concavity in the profile of the tympanic bulla.  Although Geisler and Sanders focused their study on the phylogeny of odontocetes, and their character 268 is similar to our character, the compression and associated concavity observed on the medial aspect of the ventral surface of balaenids may not be homologous between baleen and toothed whales.  The bulla is inflated in the plesiomorphic state, but the dorsoventral compression of the bulla characterizes the apomorphic state of this character.  The concavity produced by the compression is on the ventral surface of the bulla, extending longitudinally.^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is observed in most cetaceans, and the typical mammalian condition for the tympanic bulla.  Dorsoventral compression (state 1) is observed only in balaenids among extant mysticetes.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was based on morphology described and the phylogram constructed by McLeod et al. (1993: character suite 8), and it was previously used in phylogenetic analyses by Kimura and Ozawa (2002: character 31), Lindow (2002: character 26), Geisler and Sanders (2003: character 268), Bisconti (2005: character 34), DemÃ©rÃ© et al. (2005: character 47, 2008: character 44), Steeman (2007: character 53), Kimura and Hasegawa (2010: character 119), and Marx (2010: character 104).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The term ''main ridge'' of the tympanic bulla (referred to as the median keel by Luo, 1998: table 2) was defined by Oishi and Hasegawa (1994: fig. 3), but the morphology of the ridge has received little to no treatment in phylogenetic analyses.  The main ridge gives the medial border of the tympanic bulla a prominent edge in many taxa, including Balaenoptera physalus.  In the plesiomorphic state, the main ridge is short and restricted to the posterior end of the bulla.  In the apomorphic state, the main ridge is long and extends from the posterior to anterior ends of the bulla.  There is some variation in the main ridge in terms of degree of dorsoventral thickness, and its edge is either bluntly rounded (e.g., Balaenoptera musculus) or keeled (e.g., Balaenoptera bonaerensis), and the main ridge is indistinct but nonetheless present in Megaptera novaeangliae.  In certain taxa, the main ridge is extended posteriorly to form a type of outer posterior prominence (e.g., Megaptera), but it is unclear whether or not this projection is homologous with the outer posterior prominence of odontocetes (e.g., Tursiops truncatus; Mead and Fordyce, 2009).^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state of a short main ridge is seen in extinct mysticetes, such as Eomysticetus whitmorei and Mammalodon colliveri.  The main ridge is long (state 1) in all extant mysticetes.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character has not been previously used in phylogenetic analyses.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The median furrow is a longitudinal sulcus that extends anteriorly from the interprominential notch (between the inner and outer posterior prominences of the bulla; see Mead and Fordyce, 2009: fig. 25; Fitzgerald, 2010: fig. 28) on the posterior border of the bulla in many cetaceans (See Kasuya, 1973; Mead and Fordyce, 2009: 141).  The furrow is homologous with several structures identified by previous researchers, including the ventral groove (e.g., Muizon, 1987; Fordyce, 1994; Kimura and Ozawa, 2002), posterior cleft (Uhen, 2004), and deep median hollow (Kellogg, 1936).  We prefer the term median furrow, following the terminology used in the landmark descriptions by Kasuya (1973: fig. 1), as well as by Mead and Fordyce (2009:141), as it complements the term ''lateral furrow'', which commonly is used to refer to a distinct mediolaterally directed groove anterior to the sigmoid process on the lateral side of the ventral surface of the bulla (see Oishi and Hasegawa, 1994: fig. 3).  The median furrow is well-developed but short in the plesiomorphic state, occupying the posterior 40% of the bulla and forming the median border of broadly rounded inner (medial and outer (lateral) posterior prominences.  The median furrow is lost all together in the apomorphic state.^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic condition is observed in some extinct mysticetes including Mammalodon colliveri and Eomysticetus whitmorei.  The furrow is altogether absent (apomorphic state) in extant mysticete species.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was based on morphology described by Muizon (1987: fig. 4), and was previously used in phylogenetic analyses by Fordyce (1994: character 59), Geisler and Luo (1998: character 18), Luo and Gingerich (1999: character 41), O''Leary and Geisler (1999: character 14), Kimura and Ozawa (2002: character 32), Lindow (2002: character 27), Geisler and Sanders (2003: character 266), DemÃ©rÃ© et al. (2005: character 49, 2008: character 45), Fitzgerald (2010: character 116), Kimura and Hasegawa (2010: character 118), and Marx (2010: character 100).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The dorsal posterior prominence is a raised swelling on the posterior portion of the dorsal surface of the involucrum (not to be confused with either the inner or outer posterior prominences of the odontocete bulla; see Mead and Fordyce, 2009).  The apomorphic state is the presence of a conspicuous dorsal posterior prominence, which is absent in the plesiomorphic condition.  ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: Oishi and Hasegawa (1994) identified the dorsal posterior prominence in Megaptera novaeangliae and several extinct taxa, but we observed variation in the development of the structure in this species, as well as in Balaenoptera musculus.  Absence of significant swelling in the posterodorsal region of the bulla (the plesiomorphic condition) characterizes the remaining mysticetes, in which the dorsal aspect of the involucrum is flattened with no anterior-posterior swelling in the area.  ^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: Presence versus absence of the dorsal posterior prominence was used in at least one study focused on mysticete systematics (Oishi and Hasegawa, 1994: character 6, fig. 4), although it was not used in a phylogenetic analysis.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: In the plesiomorphic state, the involucral ridge extends to the medial border of the bulla, which is formed by the main ridge, when the bulla is in dorsal view (Oishi and Hasegawa, 1994: fig. 3).  The involucral ridge is laterally retracted from the main ridge and does not extend to the medial border of the bulla in the apomorphic state.^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state characterizes Eomysticetus whitmorei, Mammalodon colliveri, Eschrichtius robustus, and the balaenoids (Balaena, Eubalaena, and Caperea).  The apomorphic state is characteristic of extant species of Balaenopteridae. However, the morphology is polymorphic for some mysticetes. For example, bullae of Balaena mysticetus exhibit both the ancestral (USNM 15695, 259000) and derived (USNM 49407, 63300) conditions. Likewise, we observed the apomorphic state in some specimens of Eubalaena glacialis (AMNH 169829, 267612, 504343, 504886), and the plesiomorphic state is observed in others (USNM 269161). ^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character has not been previously used in phylogenetic analyses.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=7 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: A ridge or shelf-like extension is located on the ventral surface of the tympanic bulla at the anterolateral end, adjacent to the anterior pedicle in some extant mysticetes. The shelf is recognizable as a slight concavity at the anterolateral corner of the bulla in ventral view (apomorphic state), and the absence of the structure is the plesiomorphic state that characterizes the anterior border of the bullae of most cetaceans and non-cetacean mammals.  Development of the shelf ventral to the opening for the Eustachian tube varies among taxa, ranging from a ridge (e.g., Balaenoptera acutorostrata) to a well-developed shelf (e.g., Balaenoptera borealis).  ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state characterizes the majority of extant mysticetes.  However, the apomorphic state in which the anterolateral shelf is present on the bullae of balaenopterids is weakly developed in Megaptera novaeangliae and Balaenoptera musculus.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character has not been previously used in phylogenetic analyses.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=8 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The conical process (referred to as the conical apophysis or middle conical process by Kellogg, 1936:113; Luo, 1998:277; Luo and Gingerich, 1999:36; see also Mead and Fordyce, 2009:136) is a raised projection along the lateral edge of the tympanic bulla, immediately posterior to the sigmoid process.  Both the sigmoid and conical processes are homologous to processes on the tympanic ring of non-cetacean mammals (Mead and Fordyce, 2009:136).  The conical process serves as the distal attachment for the conical tympanic ligament (Luo, 1998).  The conical tympanic ligament may be homologous to all (Lancaster, 1990; Luo, 1998) or part (Fraser and Purves, 1960) of the planar tympanic membrane of terrestrial mammals. The proximal end of the conical tympanic ligament originates on the manubrium of the malleus (Luo, 1998).  The height of the conical process was measured as the greatest distance between the apex and base of the process, where the base was determined to be at the level of the lateral lip of the tympanic bulla, as viewed ventrally.  The length of the conical process was measured as the greatest distance perpendicular to the height (Table S5).  In the plesiomorphic state, the conical process is short (50% of length) characterizes apomorphic state 2.^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The conical process is weakly developed or absent (plesiomorphic state) in extant balaenids and the neobalaenid Caperea marginata, but the structure is developed as an distinctly arched bullar feature in all other extant mysticetes.  The process is short (apomorphic state 1) in Balaenoptera acutorostrata, Balaenoptera borealis, and Balaenoptera musculus, but the process is tall (apomorphic state 2) in all remaining balaenopteroid taxa, including Eschrichtius robustus.  We were unable to measure the conical processes of Mammalodon colliveri and Eomysticetus whitmorei.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character has not been previously used in phylogenetic analyses.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=9 TEXT='DESRIPTION: The conical process is situated on the lateral lip of the tympanic bulla, immediately posterior to the sigmoid process, and the dorsoventral thickness of the process varies among mysticetes.  In the plesiomorphic state, the conical process is thick, and is developed as a globular structure with a rounded anterior end.   In apomorphic state 1, the anterior lip of the conical process is thin, giving the crest of the conical process a roughly triangular shape in dorsal view. The conical process is uniformly thin across its length in apomorphic state 2.  ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is observed in Eschrichtius robustus, as well as in several archaeocetes and odontocetes (personal observation).  Apomorphic state 1, in which the anterior lip of the conical process is thin, is observed in extant balaenopterids, while extant balaenoids are characterized by apomorphic state 2.

In the apomorphic state, the bulla extends posteriorly from the ostium for a considerable distance, which places the sigmoid and conical processes at or near the midpoint of the longitudinal axis of the bulla (note that this is the case when considering the anterior-posterior length of the bulla as a whole, and not the opening of the tympanic cavity).^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic condition is observed in most extant mysticetes, except for Balaenoptera musculus, which exhibits the apomorphic condition.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character has not been previously used in phylogenetic analyses.';

Conversely, the surface is planar and almost concave, primarily in the anterior-posterior direction, in the apomorphic state.  ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: Most mysticetes exhibit the pelsiomorphic state, but the apomorphic state was observed in Balaenoptera acutorostrata and Balaenoptera bonaerensis.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character has not been previously used in phylogenetic analyses.';

In some taxa, the main ridge is further modified and flattened medially, particularly at the posterior end of the ridge (apomorphic state).  In the plesiomorphic state, the posterior portion of the medial margin of the bulla is gently rounded and not developed into a flattened margin.  ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is observed in most mysticetes.  An elevated and flattened medial margin (apomorphic state) is present in Balaenoptera musculus and Balaenoptera physalus, particularly at the posterior end, where the main ridge is developed as an elongate plateau.

The total length of the bulla is the greatest anterior-posterior distance along the long axis of the bulla (Table S4).  The anterior lobe contributes 40% or more to the total length of the tympanic bulla in the plesiomorphic condition, but the lobe is shortened, contributing less than 30% to the total bullar length in the apomorphic state.^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: Most cetaceans possess long anterior lobes of the bullae (plesiomorphic state), although the anterior lobe is shortened in extant balaenids and neobalaenids (apomorphic state).  The anterior lobe of Balaenoptera musculus is relatively shorter than that of other balaenopterids owing to the posterior extension of the bulla behind the ostium of the tympanic cavity, but the lobe is not reduced in B. musculus to the same degree as in balaenoids.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character has not been previously used in phylogenetic analyses.';

However, the two ridges converge at either the posterior (apomorphic state 1), or the anterior end of the bulla (apomorphic state 2).^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is observed in Eschrichtius robustus, Balaenoptera musculus, and Balaenoptera physalus, where the involucral and main ridges are parallel to one another along the length of the bulla.

The retraction of the involucral ridge in Megaptera is not as pronounced as that observed in Eschrichtius, but it does not contact the posterior border of the bulla.  The involucral ridge extends to the posterior end of the bulla (apomorphic state 1) in extant species of Balaenoptera.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was based on morphology described by Oishi and Hasegawa (1994: character 5), but it has not been previously used in phylogenetic analyses.';

	TEXT CHARACTER=18 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: In mysticetes, the lateral aspect of the anterior process of the petrosal is expanded into a distinct extension lateral to the anterior pedicle for the tympanic bulla.  The lateral extension in mysticetes is in a similar position to the ventrolateral tuberosity of odontocetes, and the two structures likely are homologous (Geisler and Sanders, 2003:53-54; however, see Geisler and Luo, 1996).  In the plesiomorphic state, the ventrolateral tuberosity of the anterior process is rounded and featureless.  In apomorphic state 1, a small flange (homologous to the lateral projection of Geisler and Luo, 1996) is present on the ventrolateral tuberosity, forming a horizontal shelf on the anterior process.  The flange is large in apomorphic state 2, and it is developed as a hypertrophied structure in apomorphic state 3.^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is exhibited by Caperea marginata among extant mysticetes, and apomorphic state 1 characterizes most baleen whales.  The flange of the ventrolateral tuberosity is large in Balaenoptera physalus and Balaenoptera musculus, but the size of the flange is variable in Balaenoptera borealis.  In balaenids, the flange of the ventrolateral tuberosity is hypertrophied, often extending posteriorly to nearly the same length as the posterior process of the petrosal.  A portion of the lateral tuberosity is preserved for Mammalodon colliveri (Fitzgerald, 2010: fig. 23), but the structure is damaged so that the presence or full extent of a flange cannot be determined.  ^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was previously used in phylogenetic analyses by Geisler and Luo (1996: character 4), Kimura and Ozawa (2002: character 54), Bisconti (2003, 2005: character 53, and 2008: character 55), Geisler and Sanders (2003: characters 210-211), Dooley et al.

	TEXT CHARACTER=19 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The anterior process of the petrosal is a neomorphic structure for Cetacea.  In the plesiomorphic state, the anterior process is separated from the apex of the promontorium by a noticeable gap.  In apomorphic state 1, the anterior process is connected to the promontorium, but the anterior process does not contact the rostral apex of the promontorium.  Rather, there is an embayment between the two structures.  There is a broader area of attachment between the anterior process and the promontorium in apomorphic state 2, where there is a continuous profile between the medial border of the anterior process and the promontorium, without an embayment as observed in state 1. ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state characterizes the extinct taxa Mammalodon colliveri and Eomysticetus whitmorei, as well as the extant mysticetes Balaenoptera musculus, Balaenoptera physalus, Eubalaena glacialis, and Balaena mysticetus.  We observed apomorphic state 1 in Balaenoptera omurai, Megaptera novaeangliae, and Eschrichtius robustus, in which there is an embayment between the anterior process and the rostral apex of the promontorium.  The anterior edge of the anterior process is convex in ventral view in apomorphic state 2, which we observed in Balaenoptera acutorostrata, Balaenoptera borealis, and Balaenoptera edeni.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character has not been previously used in phylogenetic analyses.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=20 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The shape of the apex of the anterior process of the petrosal is diagnostic for several different groups of mysticetes.  In the plesiomorphic state, the apex of the anterior process is rounded.  However, the anterior process assumes a triangular shape with either a narrow (apomorphic state 1) or blunt apex (apomorphic state 2) in many extant species.  A third derived condition (apomorphic state 3) is an elongated and inflated anterior process.  ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: We observed the plesiomorphic state in extant balaenids.  The apex of the anterior process is narrowly triangular (apomorphic state 1) in several balaenopterids, including Balaenoptera physalus, Balaenoptera edeni, and Balaenoptera borealis, and the anterior process is triangular in Megaptera novaeangliae and Eschrichtius robustus, although the apex is blunt compared to many species of Balaenoptera (apomorphic state 2).  Caperea marginata is unique among extant mysticetes in that the anterior process of this species is elongated and inflated (apomorphic state 3).^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was previously used in phylogenetic analyses by Luo and Gingerich (1999: character 11), Geisler and Sanders (2003: character 201), Kimura and Hasegawa (2010: character 89), and O''Leary (2010: character 12).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=21 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: A groove is observed extending along the anteromedial edge of the anterior process and terminating at the foramen ovale in the articulated skulls of some species of Balaenoptera (e.g., B. acutorostrata and B. physalus), which we interpret to be the anterointernal sulcus.  Absence of the sulcus is the plesiomorphic state, and presence characterizes apomorphic state 1.  An anteroexternal sulcus has been described for other cetaceans (e.g., Fordyce, 1994:161, fig. 11; Geisler and Sanders, 2003: character 205; Fitzgerald, 2010:33-36, fig. 23-26), including Mammalodon colliveri.  In this toothed mysticete, the anteroexternal sulcus is directed towards the foramen ovale (although it is unclear from published descriptions if it leads directly to the opening; Fitzgerald, 2010), which has been interpreted to carry the middle meningeal artery in life.  The middle meningeal artery exits the cranial cavity through the foramen ovale in dogs and humans, along with the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (Pick and Howden, 1977; Evans, 1993).  The sulcus that we observed in B. physalus may be homologous to the anteroexternal sulcus of Mammalodon (Fitzgerald, 2010) and others, but it is not in the same position.  Two grooves that have been termed anterointernal sulci were described for the extinct cetacean Waipatia (Fordyce, 1994: p. 158, fig. 11), although the specimen also possesses an anteroexternal sulcus.  The location of the anterointernal sucli in Waipatia agrees with that of the sulcus that we observed in the extant balaenopterids identified above, and we suggest that the sulcus is homologous to one of the anterointernal sulci as described by Fordyce (1994), given the similarities in position.  Although there are few detailed dissections through the ear region of mysticetes, we suggest that the occupant of the anterointernal sulcus is the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, given the relationship between the sulcus and the foramen ovale.  The trigeminal nerve is the fifth cranial nerve, which separates into the opthalmic and maxillary branches for sensory input, and the mixed sensory and motor mandibular branch (Evans, 1993).  One of the anterointernal sulci in Waipatia may have transmitted the lesser petrosal nerve (Fordyce, 1994), which may also pass through the foramen ovale along with the trigeminal nerve. ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: In the plesiomorphic state that we observed in the balaenopteroids B. edeni, B. omurai, B. musculus, B. physalus, Eschrichtius robustus, and Megaptera novaeangliae, no anterointernal sulcus is developed on the anterior process.  Apomorphic state 1, in which the anterointernal sulcus is present, is seen in B. acutorostrata and B. bonaerensis.  The sulcus is evident as a broad and distinct groove extending in an anterior-posterior direction on the medial side of the anterior process in B. acutorostrata, and the sulcus is variably developed (0/1) in B. physalus and B. borealis.  In some individuals of B. borealis, the sulcus is positioned more ventrally than in others.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was based on morphology described by Fordyce (1994:158, fig. 11).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=22 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The petrosal of some mysticetes possesses several thin, bony projections along the anterior margin of the anterior process (apomorphic state 1), which are absent in the plesiomorphic state. ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is seen in most extinct and extant mysticetes.  In the apomorphic condition, which is an autapomorphy for Balaenoptera omurai among extant species, several thin bony projections are developed along the anterior margin of the anterior process in some undescribed mysticete fossils.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character has not been previously used in phylogenetic analyses.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=23 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The vascularization through the ear region of cetaceans and close terrestrial relatives of Cetacea has garnered interest among the scientific community (e.g., Geisler and Luo, 1998), particularly on account of the systematic value of osteological correlates of blood vessels.  In some mysticetes, there is development of a distinct groove that likely is homologous to the anteroexternal sulcus observed in the extinct odontocete Waipatia (Fordyce, 1994) and the toothed mysticete Mammalodon (Fitzgerald, 2010).  The well-developed sulcus is present in the plesiomorphic state anterior to the lateral projection of the anterior process of the petrosal.  The groove runs between the petrosal and squamosal, and it follows a course that begins near the junction of the pars cochlearis and posterior border of the anterior process, and it terminates at the anterior pedicle.  The groove is absent in the apomorphic state.  The occupant of the sulcus is unknown owing to the paucity of detailed dissections and descriptions of the nerves and blood vessels that cross through the ear region of mysticetes.  However, two possibilities are the capsuloparietal emissary vein (Geisler and Luo, 1998), which is a major vessel that branches from the sigmoid sinus (Padget, 1957) and drains the cranial cavity in the postglenoid region of the skull, and the middle meningeal artery (Fitzgerald, 2010), which is a major supplier of blood to the meninges (Evans, 1993).^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is observed in the extinct Mammalodon colliveri and the extant Eschrichtius robustus.  The groove is present in some neonate balaenopterids, including B. acutorostrata (SDSU S970) and B. physalus (LACM 72507), but the groove is absent in adults of those species. However, the groove is present in both neonate (SDSNH 23762) and adult (SDSNH 24316) E. robustus individuals.  Because the sulcus is absent in adults of B. acutorostrata and B. physalus, the taxa are scored as possessing the apomorphic state.  In the derived condition, the anteroexternal sulcus is not well developed, which characterizes by most balaenids and balaenopterids (excluding neonatal B. acutorostrata and B. physalus).  The presence or absence of the groove in Eomysticetus whitmorei could not be determined.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was based morphology described by Fordyce (1994) and Geisler and Luo (1998), and it was previously used in phylogenetic analyses by Geisler and Sanders (2003: character 206) and Fitzgerald (2010: character 82).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=24 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: In the plesiomorphic state, there is no dorsal extension of the tegmen tympani and pars cochlearis. Rather, the connection between the dorsal surface of the anterior process and the pars cochlearis is relatively flat or else the pars cochlearis is elevated above the tegmen tympani, as seen in Balaenoptera musculus.  In the apomorphic state, the junction between the tegmen tympani and pars cochlearis on the dorsal side of the petrosal is extended as a robust pyramidal process, towards which both the tegmen tympani and pars cochlearis contribute.^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is observed in Eomysticetus whitmorei, Mammalodon colliveri, and balaenopterids.

	TEXT CHARACTER=25 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: In the plesiomorphic state, the posterior process of the petrosal is posterolaterally oriented relative to the long axis of the pars cochlearis (promontorium).  In this condition, the posterior process extends in line with the long axis of the promontorium.  In the apomorphic state, the posterior process is oriented at a right angle to the pars cochlearis.   ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is characteristic of most mysticetes, although the apomorphic state is observed in balaenids and neobalaenids.  The posterior process is missing from isolated petrosals of Mammalodon colliveri (Fitzgerald, 2010). ^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was previously used in phylogenetic analyses by Geisler and Luo (1996: character 22), Luo and Marsh (1996: character 23), Fitzgerald (2010: character 110), and Kimura and Hasegawa (2010: character 108).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=26 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The posterior cochlear crest (sensu Fordyce, 2002:205, fig. 15) extends posterolaterally from the bridge of bone separating the fenestrae cochleae and vestibuli (termed the crista interfenestralis).  The structure often is referred to as the ''caudal tympanic process'' in cetacean literature (e.g., Geisler and Luo, 1996:fig. 3), but this can be confused with a non-homologous structure on the posterior portion of the petrosal that is called the caudal tympanic process of terrestrial mammals (e.g., MacPhee, 1981:50; Wible et al., 2001:8; Ekdale et al., 2004:170; see Mead and Fordyce, 2009 for further discussion).  Because of this, we prefer ''posterior cochlear crest'' to avoid confusion and eliminate any potential assertions of homology between the two evolutionarily independent structures.  In the plesiomorphic state, the area between the two fenestrae is smooth or with a small bump, but not a distinct posterior cochlear crest.   In apomorphic state 1, the posterior cochlear crest is large, in some cases forming a shelf.  In apomorphic state 2, the posterior cochlear crest is large and ventrally directed.  In the apomorphic conditions, the posterior cochlear crest may join with the tympanohyal on the posterior process, thereby forming a bony channel for the hyomandibular branch of the facial nerve.  ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The ancestral condition characterizes Eomysticetus whitmorei.

	TEXT CHARACTER=27 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The elongation of the pars cochlearis is best expressed as a ratio between the width and longitudinal length of the promontorium (which forms the ventral aspect of the pars cochlearis).  The length of the promontorium was measured from the fenestra cochleae to the anteriormost extent of the promontorium, and the width was measured as the longest axis of the promontorium, perpendicular to the width.  In the plesiomorphic state, the ratio of transverse width to longitudinal length of the pars cochlearis is between 0.5 and 1.0. Ancestrally, the promontorium is globular, and it almost appears as though it is a separate element fused to the remainder of the pars cochlearis.  In the apomorphic state, the width-length ratio is much greater than 1 and often closer to 2 (Geisler and Luo, 1996), and the promontorium flares at its anterolateral aspect.  The transverse elongation of the pars cochlearis is associated with a ventral flattening of the promontorium in some taxa (e.g., Balaenoptera acutorostrata), although the promontoria of Balaenoptera musculus and Balaenoptera physalus are markedly more convex in their ventral aspect.  ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is observed in Balaenoidea and the apomorphic state is observed in Balaenopteroidea.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was previously used in phylogenetic analyses by Geisler and Luo (1996: character 12), Luo and Marsh (1996: character 18), Kimura and Ozawa (2002: character 61), Geisler and Sanders (2003: character 230), Dooley et al.

	TEXT CHARACTER=28 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The tensor tympani muscle originates on the ventral surface of the petrosal and inserts onto the malleus (Pick and Howden, 1977; Fleischer, 1978). When contracted, the muscle pulls on the malleus which tenses the tympanic membrane.  In odontocetes, the tensor tympani muscle originates on the accessory ossicle (Yamada, 1953; Mead and Fordyce, 2009).  However, the accessory ossicle is not present in mysticetes.  The accessory ossicle is fused embryonically with the anterior process in mysticetes, and tensor tympani muscle originates from a "furrow between the [anterior] process and cochlear sphere" on the mysticete petrosal (Yamada, 1953:51).  The tensor tympani muscle fossa of the plesiomorphic state is a large and oval depression situated between the anterior process of the petrosal and the anterior edge of the promontorium. The attachment site of the tensor tympani in apomorphic state 1 is a well defined groove, which is relatively small compared to the oval fossa observed in the plesiomorphic state.  The attachment for the muscle is absent or very poorly developed in apomorphic state 2.^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is present in Balaenoptera omurai, and Mammalodon colliveri, Eomysticetus whitmorei, and balaenoids exhibit apomorphic state 1.

	TEXT CHARACTER=32 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: Separation of the perilymphatic foramen (for transmission of the perilymphatic duct) and fenestra cochleae (covered by a secondary tympanic membrane) occurs in most mammals, including most mysticetes.  The two openings are widely separated in the plesiomorphic state, but the openings are more closely spaced in apomorphic state 1.  At the extreme, the perilymphatic foramen is confluent with the fenestra cochleae by a broad groove in apomorphic state 2.  The confluence between the fenestra cochleae and perilymphatic foramen in proboscideans was hypothesized to be related to low-frequency hearing (Court, 1994).  Eschrichtiids are likely sensitive to low-frequency vibrations (Erbe, 2002), given that they vocalize using low frequency and even infrasonic sounds.  However, all mysticetes are likely sensitive to low frequency sounds (although no audiogram data are available for mysticetes).  A more thorough study of the ear regions of mysticetes, as well as other taxa in which the perilymphatic foramen is confluent with the fenestra cochleae (i.e., proboscideans and sirenians) would be useful in uncovering the relationship, if any, between auditory physiology and the perilymphatic foramen.TAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: Wide separation of the perilymphatic and the fenestra cochleae (plesiomorphic state) occurs in Mammalodon colliveri, Megaptera novaeangliae and balaenids.  The bony separation between the two foramina is very narrow (apomorphic state 1) in most other mysticetes, although in the extreme case of Eschrichtius robustus, the perilymphatic foramen is confluent with the fenestra cochleae by a broad groove (apomorphic state 2).  In this condition, the bony separation between the perilymphatic duct and the fenestra rotunda does not ossify, which is convergent (or a reversal) to the state early non-therian mammals (see Wible, 1990).  Among extant mammals, the perilymphatic foramen and fenestra cochleae are confluent in sirenians and proboscideans (Fischer, 1990; Court, 1994) in addition to E. robustus.  A much narrower and slit-like confluence occurs in some specimens of immature Balaenoptera physalus, although the perilymphatic foramen is separate from the fenestra cochleae in most B. physalus specimens.  Balaenoptera physalus is scored as polymorphic (1/2) in the present matrix.

	TEXT CHARACTER=33 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The suprameatal region of the petrosal is situated on the dorsal surface of the pars cochlearis, dorsal to the internal auditory meatus.  In the plesiomorphic state, the suprameatal region forms a broad concavity known as the suprameatal fossa, although the suprameatal area is flat or convex without a broad and shallow fossa in the apomorphic state. ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: A suprameatal fossa is present (plesiomorphic state) in Eomysticetus whitmorei, Caperea marginata, Eschrichtius robustus, and Balaenoptera acutorostrata.

The suprameatal region of the petrosal is not elevated in the plesiomorphic state.^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state, in which the suprameatal region is not elevated dorsally, characterizes Mammalodon colliveri, Eomysticetus whitmorei, balaenids, and some balaenopterids (B. bonaerensis, B. borealis, and B. edeni). Note that in balaenids, the dorsolateral border of the pars cochlearis contributes to the dorsal pyramidal extension of the petrosal.

	TEXT CHARACTER=35 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The crista transversa is a crest of bone that sits within the internal acoustic meatus and separates the internal opening of the facial nerve (CN VII) canal from the opening for the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII).  In the plesiomorphic state, the crista transversa is low and does not reach the cerebellar surface of the petrosal, forming a very deep internal acoustic meatus.  In the apomorphic state, the crista transversa is high and extends to the cerebral surface.  Although both states are observed across Mysticeti, the depth of the crista transversa within the internal acoustic meatus may change throughout ontogeny (Bisconti, 2001).^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The ancestral condition characterizes Eomysticetus whitmorei, Balaenidae, Megaptera novaeangliae and some Balaenoptera species (namely B. borealis, B. edeni, and B. musculus).

A very narrow separation that is less than 112% of the interfenestral distance characterizes the plesiomorphic state.  In apomorphic state 1, the distance between fenestra cochleae and endolymphatic foramen is 121-185% of interfenestral distance.

	TEXT CHARACTER=43 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: In mysticetes, the malleus typically is fused to the tympanic bulla, near the sigmoid process.  However, the malleus articulates with the petrosal in some taxa, leaving a trace as a malleolar fossa lateral to the promontorium.  The fossa for the malleus indicates articulation between the ossicle and the petrosal, although whether or not the ossicles themselves are functional from an auditory standpoint, as well as the transmission pathway of sound vibrations in mysticetes, is controversial (Norris, 1981; Ketten, 1992; Nummela, 2008).  A distinct fossa for the head of the malleus is the plesiomorphic state (Geisler and Luo, 1996:1054), although the fossa is lost to varying degrees in many mysticetes.  In apomorphic state 1, the fossa is partially defined along its medial edge, and the fossa is all together absent in apomorphic state 2.  ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is seen in Eomysticetus whitmorei, but none of the extant mysticetes that we examined.  In most balaenopteroids, the posterolateral edge of the fossa is well-defined; however, the medial edge is less distinct (apomorphic condition 1).  In Eschrichtius robustus and balaenoids, the fossa for the malleus is poorly differentiated from other structures in the epitympanic region (apomorphic condition 2).^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was based on the morphological descriptions of Luo and Eastman (1995), and it was previously used in phylogenetic analyses by Geisler and Luo (1996: character 9, 1998: character 4), Luo and Gingerich (1999: character 6), Kimura and Hasegawa (2010: character 96), and O''Leary (2010: character 15).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=44 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: This character describes the ventral definition of the stylomastoid fossa.    In the ancestral condition, the contact between the stylomastoid fossa and the ventral surface of the promontorium is not well-developed.  In apomorphic state 1, the edge is well-developed as a short keel.  This character state also applies to petrosals that display any degree of a sharp edge.  In apomorphic state 2, the edge is well developed and extends as an elongate, broad flange.  Although more detailed dissections through the ear region of mysticetes are needed before the occupant of the fossa can be identified, the stylomastoid fossa may accommodate part of the peribullary sinus or posterior sinus in life (Fraser and Purves, 1960; Mead and Fordyce, 2009).^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: In the ancestral condition seen in balaenids, Caperea marginata, Eschrichtius robustus, and Eomysticetus whitmorei.

In apomorphic state 1, the hiatus Fallopii opens within the juncture between the promontorium and anterior process.  The hiatus Fallopii is situated lateral to the juncture in apomorphic state 2.  ^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The ancestral condition characterizes the balaenids, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, Balaenoptera bonaerensis, and Balaenoptera musculus (in which the hiatus opens on the anterior edge of the promontorium, similar to that in many terrestrial mammals; see Cifelli, 1982).

	TEXT CHARACTER=46 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The promontorium houses the cochlea within the inner ear.  In the plesiomorphic state, the promontorium develops as a convex structure on the ventral side of the petrosal.

However, the promontorium is ventrally flattened (apomorphic state) in remaining members of Balaenoptera.  Coupled with the transverse, dorsomedial elongation of the promontorium, the flattening gives the pars cochlearis of these taxa a medially flaring appearance.^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character has not been previously used in phylogenetic analyses.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=47 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The shape of the internal opening of the facial nerve canal (within the internal acoustic meatus) varies among mysticetes.  In the plesiomorphic state, the opening is circular, whereas the opening is oval in apomorphic state 1.  In apomorphic state 2, the opening for the facial canal is oval with an anterior fissure.^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The plesiomorphic state is expressed by Mammalodon colliveri, Balaenidae, Balaenoptera borealis, Balaenoptera bonaerensis, and Megaptera novaeangliae.  We observed apomorphic condition 1 in all other balaenopterid species and Caperea marginata, and apomorphic condition 2 in Eschrichtius robustus.  A similar condition to E. robustus was observed in a specimen of Eubalaena glacialis by Geisler and Luo (1996), but specimens of E. glacialis studied here (AMNH 169829; LACM 54763) lack the groove that is very distinct in E. robustus.  The endocranial opening of the facial canal is circular in AMNH 169829, and we score Eubalaena sp. thusly (state 0), rather than as polymorphic.  Geisler and Luo (1996) argued that the anterior fissure of the endocranial opening of the facial canal transmitted the greater superficial petrosal nerve in life.  The greater superficial petrosal nerve typically exits via an opening called the hiatus Fallopii on the anterior (e.g., Balaenoptera musculus) or ventral (e.g., Balaenoptera acutorostrata) surface of the petrosal in other cetaceans and non-cetacean mammals.  Geisler and Luo did not identify the hiatus Fallopii for E. glacialis, but the structure is present along the lateral border of the promontorium in the E. glacialis specimens studied here.  Furthermore, both the hiatus Fallopii and the anterior fissure of the internal opening of the facial canal are present in E. robustus (LACM 54541 and SDNHM 24316), so the greater superficial petrosal nerve likely did not travel within the anterior fissure.  The occupant of the fissure is not known at the present time.  ^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was previously used in phylogenetic analyses by Geisler and Luo (1996: character 20), Luo and Marsh (1996: character 30), Kimura and Ozawa (2002: character 69), Geisler and Sanders (2003: character 238), Dooley et al.

	TEXT CHARACTER=48 TEXT='DESCRIPTION: The angle between the posterior process and the flange of the ventrolateral tuberosity varies among extant mysticetes.  In the plesiomorphic state, the angle is well over 90 degrees.  In apomorphic state 1, the long axes of the processes form close to a right angle, but the condition in apomorphic state 2 is for the axes to form an acute angle.^n^nTAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION: The ancestral condition is seen in Eomysticetus whitmorei (as identified by Churchill, 2007) and Caperea marginata.  Apomorphic state 1 is exhibited by balaenopteroids, and apomorphic state 2 is observed in balaenids.  The acute angle in balaenids appears to be associated with the posterior hypertrophication of the flange of the ventrolateral tuberosity.  ^n^nHISTORICAL USAGE: This character was based on morphology described by Miller (1924) and Fitzgerald (2005), and it was previously used in phylogenetic analyses by Churchill (2007: character 56).';
