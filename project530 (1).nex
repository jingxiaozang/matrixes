        [Character comments]
        	TEXT CHARACTER=1 TEXT='Within Pinnipedia, fusion of the mandibles at the symphysis only occurs amongst walruses. Five odobenids exhibit the derived condition (a fused symphysis): Pelagiarctos thomasi, Dusignathus seftoni, Valenictus chulavistensis, Odobenus mandanoensis, and Odobenus rosmarus. Pelagiarctos sp. Dusignathus santacruzensis, and all other fossil odobenids have unfused symphyses.  Character 39 of DemÃ©rÃ©  (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=2 TEXT='This character describes the length of the mandibular symphysis relative to the length of the horizontal ramus, and the derived condition constitutes mandibles with mandibular symphyses that are greater than 50% of the length of the horizontal ramus. The derived condition characterizes Dusignathus, Gomphotaria, Protodobenus, Ontocetus, Valenictus, and Odobenus. Pelagiarctos could not be scored for this character. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='The presence and size of the genial tuberosity on the ventral margin of the horizontal ramus varies among pinnipeds. No apparent genial tuberosity is present in "Enaliarctines", Proneotherium, or Neotherium, while a small tubercle is present in Kamtschatarctos, Protodobenus, Valenictus, and Odobenus. In some odobenids (Pelagiarctos, Imagotaria, Pontolis, Dusignathus, and Ontocetus) the genial tuberosity is well developed and extends far below the ventral margin of the horizontal ramus. In Gomphotaria pugnax, the genial tuberosity is poorly formed and characterized by rugose ridges posterolateral to the symphysis on each dentary, and not visible in lateral view. For this reason, this character was coded as 0 for Gomphotaria. New character.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='In most pinnipeds (and carnivores in general), the cortical bone surface of the entire mandible is typically smooth. However, in certain large odobenids, the anterior end of the symphyseal region of the mandibles exhibits rugose and vascularized bone with many minute foramina. This condition is present in Pelagiarctos, Pontolis, Gomphotaria, Dusignathus seftoni, Ontocetus, Valenictus chulavistensis, and Odobenus. The derived condition is also present in adult males of large-bodied extant pinnipeds such as Otaria byronia, Eumetopias jubatus, and Mirounga angustirostris. Character 41 of DemÃ©rÃ©  (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='This character describes the orientation of the symphyseal portion of the mandible relative to the rest of the horizontal ramus. The derived condition characterizes Valenictus and Ontocetus, where the horizontal ramus is upturned and anterodorsally oriented relative to the ascending ramus. All other odobenids (including Odobenus, Protodobenus, and all early diverging odobenids) have a dorsal margin of the horizontal ramus that is straight. The primitive condition is present in Pelagiarctos. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='This character describes the presence or absence of a longitudinal and transversely concave furrow running along the dorsal margin of the mandibular symphysis. The derived condition is exhibited by Odobenus and Valenictus. Pelagiarctos and all other odobenids have the primitive condition. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=7 TEXT='This character is defined as an edentulous anterior extremity of the symphyseal portion of the mandible. The anterior end of the mandible is anteriorly expanded and edentulous in Ontocetus, Valenictus, and Odobenus. In Valenictus and (occasionally) Odobenus, it is transversely expanded into a "spoon" shape. The presence of this character in Ontocetus suggests that it is decoupled from symphyseal fusion and incisor loss. Pelagiarctos exhibits the primitive condition. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=8 TEXT='This character relates to the posterior extension of the mandibular symphysis, and whether it extends to the anterior premolars or posterior to the second lower premolar. The derived condition characterizes Gomphotaria pugnax, Pontolis magnus, Dusignathus santacruzensis, and Ontocetus. All other odobenids (notably including Protodobenus, Dusignathus seftoni, and Odobenus) exhibit the primitive condition. Valenictus chulavistensis was scored as a "?" because of the lack of dentition. Pelagiarctos exhibits the primitive condition. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=9 TEXT='This character relates to the position of the dorsoventrally deepest part of the horizontal ramus. In most carnivora, the dorsoventrally deepest portion of the horizontal ramus is positioned posteriorly near the P4 and M1, and likely relates to the use of enlarged carnassial teeth for mastication. The primitive condition also characterizes Enaliarctos and Pteronarctos. However, in all modern and fossil pinnipeds (sensu Berta and Wyss 1994) the deepest part of the horizontal ramus is positioned at the mandibular symphysis, and the mandible becomes deeper anteriorly towards the symphysis. This probably relates to the loss of shearing carnassial teeth and the functional transition from a masticating dentition to a pierce-feeding dentition during early pinniped evolution. Pelagiarctos (and all other odobenids) exhibit the derived condition. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=10 TEXT='Most pinnipeds are characterized by having mandibles that in dorsal view are nearly parallel or slightly divergent. However, some odobenids have widely divergent mandibles, likely resultant from the evolution of short and wide rostra. The derived condition (widely divergent mandibles) occurs in Dusignathus, Protodobenus, Ontocetus, Valenictus, and Odobenus. Pelagiarctos exhibits the primitive condition. Character 42 from DemÃ©rÃ©  (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=11 TEXT='This character describes the shape of the ventral margin of the mandible. In most pinnipeds and odobenids, the ventral margin is straight (e.g. Proneotherium, Neotherium, Pelagiarctos, Odobenus). However, a sinuous ventral margin is present in Dusignathus, Pontolis magnus, and some specimens of Imagotaria. Pelagiarctos has a straight ventral border of the mandible. Character 43 from DemÃ©rÃ©  (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=12 TEXT='According to Berta and Wyss (1994), this feature diagnoses only desmatophocids. This character has been modified for dusignathine and odobenine walruses. Dusignathus does not have a "bony flange" (=digastric insertion) that has a posterior projection as in desmatophocids, but the digastric insertion is elongate, and robust; well-developed digastric insertions also appear in Pontolis, Odobenus, Valenictus, and Ontocetus. A large digastric insertion also occurs in Eumetopias, Otaria, Phocarctos, and Mirounga (and some specimens of Arctocephalus pusillus). The digastric insertion is not enlarged in Pelagiarctos (state 0). Modified from character 52 of Berta and Wyss (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=13 TEXT='The position of the mandibular condyle is variable within pinnipeds, and within most pinnipeds and terrestrial carnivorans, the condyle is positioned at approximately the same level as the tooth row. However, in certain odobenids such as Valenictus and Ontocetus, the condyle is dorsally elevated above the tooth row. This character could not be coded for Pelagiarctos. The derived condition also characterizes Desmatophocidae (Berta and Wyss, 1994). Modified from Character 53 of Berta and Wyss (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=14 TEXT='This character refers to the direction of the anterior margin of the mandibular foramen on the medial surface of the mandible. In most odobenids, the mandibular foramen is directed anterodorsally, while in Neotherium, Imagotaria, and Odobenus,  the mandibular foramen is directed anteroventrally. The derived condition was originally used by Berta and DemÃ©rÃ©  (1986) to differentiate fossil Callorhinus from Arctocephalus. Character 9 of Berta and DemÃ©rÃ©  (1986).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=15 TEXT='In most pinnipeds the angular process (= pterygoid process) is a small and tabular process situated along the posteroventral margin of the mandible. In derived odobenids, the angular process forms a small medial shelf. Such a shelf is absent in "enaliarctines", Proneotherium, Neotherium, Imagotaria, and is present in all other odobenids (where preserved). All modern otariids exhibit a medial shelf of the angular process, and at least fossil species within extant genus (Callorhinus gilmorei) lacks this feature, unlike its extant congener (Berta and DemÃ©rÃ©, 1986). Character 24 from Berta and DemÃ©rÃ© (1986) and character 51 of Berta and Wyss (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=16 TEXT='Most pinnipeds have coronoid processes that are relatively anteroposteriorly short. Two odobenids (Pontolis and Odobenus) have elongate coronoid processes that at least 42% of the length of the dentary. This character could not be coded for Pelagiarctos. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=17 TEXT='The possession of three lower incisors per side is the primitive condition for arctoid carnivorans. Enaliarctos emlongi and Pteronarctos goedertae and most otariids and phocids have two lower incisors per side, and have lost the medial incisor. Pontolis and Dusignathus seftoni only have one lower incisor, while Gomphotaria, Valenictus, and Odobenus lack incisors altogether. The primitive character state is present in "enaliarctines", all other "imagotariines" s. l. (including Pelagiarctos), and Dusignathus santacruzensis. Character 60 from Berta and Wyss (1994).^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=18 TEXT='Arctoid carnivorans (and pinnipeds) primitively exhibit lower incisors that are of equal size and are arrayed in an arcade. In more derived forms, such as some odobenids and "otariine" sea lions, the lateral incisor is enlarged while the small medial incisor is positioned posteromedially; this makes the incisor alveoli appear ''V'' shaped. In Eumetopias jubatus the medial incisor is more anteriorly oriented than the lateral incisor to compensate for its posterior position, and the incisor crowns still form an arcade. "Enaliarctines" and Neotherium are characterized by the primitive condition (state 0). Pelagiarctos exhibits lateral incisors with roots that are only slightly wider than medial incisors, but the medial incisors are posteriorly positioned (state 1). Imagotaria, Dusignathus santacruzensis, Ontocetus, and Protodobenus exhibit the derived condition (state 1); Proneotheriium, Kamtschatarctos, Dusignathus seftoni, Gomphotaria, Valenictus, and Odobenus could not be coded for this character because of the lack of preserved incisors or well preserved alveoli, loss of medial incisors, or loss of both lower incisors. Modified from character 131 of Bininda-Emonds and Russell (1996).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=19 TEXT='Upper and lower canines are primitively similar in size amongst arctoid carnivorans and pinnipeds. Odobenids primitively have caniniform canines. Odobenine walruses, however, are characterized by having low-crowned, premolariform lower canines that are reduced in size, evolving in concert with enlarged upper canines DemÃ©rÃ© 1994). Reduction of lower canine size occurs within Protodobenus, Ontocetus, and Odobenus, which possess state 1 (a lower canine that is less than 75% of the width of the upper canine). Further reduction occurs in Valenictus, which has lost the lower canine (state 2). Although upper canines are unknown for Pelagiarctos, its lower canine is caniniform and thus represents the primitive condition. Modified from characters 28 and 31 of DemÃ©rÃ© (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=20 TEXT='A posterior crista (=crest or carina) is primitively present on arctoid carnivoran and pinniped canines. Barnes and Raschke (1991) noted that a posterior crista was lacking on the lower canines of Dusignathus santacruzensis and Gomphotaria, uniting them within the Dusignathinae. A new specimen of Dusignathus seftoni also lacks a posterior crista, and so does Pontolis magnus; in these taxa, this is related to the enlargement and tusk-like development of the lower canines. However, we note that a posterior crista is also absent in odobenines such as Protodobenus, Ontocetus, and Odobenus. Pelagiarctos, "enaliarctines", Proneotherium, Neotherium, and Imagotaria all exhibit the primitive condition. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=21 TEXT='Most carnivorans and pinnipeds exhibit smooth enamel on their canines. However, the lower canines of Gomphotaria and Dusignathus seftoni have elongate, longitudinal grooves or ''fluting'' in the surface of the tooth. Longitudinal fluting also characterizes upper canines of Ontocetus and some specimens of Valenictus and Odobenus. Pelagiarctos has smooth enamel on its lower canines. In Gomphotaria, the postcanines and upper incisors are also longitudinally fluted. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=22 TEXT='Most pinnipeds and other carnivorans have lower canines with a circular or oval-shaped cross section. The canines of Pelagiarctos and Imagotaria have longitudinal sulci that give the tooth a bilobate cross section (Barnes 1988). The derived condition is present in the holotype of Imagotaria downsi, but is less evident in referred material from the Santa Margarita Sandstone (USNM 23858) and UCMP 88459) because the canines are only partially erupted. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=23 TEXT='Pinnipeds and arctoid carnivorans primitively have canines that are vertically oriented. Dusignathus santacruzensis, Dusignathus seftoni, and Gomphotaria, on the other hand, have lower canines that are procumbent and are directed anterodorsally. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=24 TEXT='Arctoid carnivorans and pinnipeds primitively possess all four lower premolars. Dental reduction in odobenins has resulted in the loss of the P4 in Odobenus and loss of all premolars in Valenictus. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=25 TEXT='Well developed enamel on postcanine teeth is primitive for carnivorans and pinnipeds. Within odobenids, enamel loss and reduction is observed: thin and patchy enamel is present in Dusignathus santacruzensis, Aivukus, Pontolis, and Gomphotaria, while enamel is not developed in the postcanine teeth of Protodobenus, Ontocetus, and Odobenus. Valenictus was scored as a ''?'' for this character. Pelagiarctos retains thick postcanine tooth enamel (state 0). Modified from character 38 of DemÃ©rÃ© (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=26 TEXT='Pinnipeds primitively exhibit postcanine tooth crowns that are linguo-labially compressed and often triangular in labial aspect. The derived condition - inflated and bulbous crowns - occurs in Pelagiarctos, Imagotaria, Dusignathus, Pontolis, Protodobenus, Ontocetus, and Odobenus. Berta and Wyss (1994) note that it occurs in Allodesmus, Desmatophoca, and some phocids (e.g. Mirounga, Halichoerus). Character 75 of Berta and Wyss (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=27 TEXT='Most pinnipeds and arctoid carnivorans have postcanine tooth roots that are relatively narrow and finger-like. However, Pontolis, Dusignathus santacruzensis, and Gomphotaria have postcanine teeth with roots that are inflated and in labial or lingual aspect, wider than their tooth crowns. Barnes and Raschke (1991) considered this addition of cementum a dusignathine character. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=28 TEXT='Pinnipediforms are characterized by having a short postcanine toothrow, which is related to the anterior crowding of teeth in the mandible (Adam and Berta 2002, Boessenecker 2011). Berta and Wyss (1994) originally considered only Pteronarctos, Callorhinus, and Otaria to exhibit the derived condition, but Adam and Berta (2002) noted that the m1 is positioned anteriorly to the halfway point of the mandible in Pteronarctos and all later diverging pinnipediforms (but not Enaliarctos). We measured postcanine tooth length and mandible length. Enaliarctos has a tooth row 49% of the mandible length, while all other pinnipedimorph taxa have a toothrow < 40% of the mandible length (~25% in Ontocetus as the shortest, and 36% in Proneotherium as the longest). Enaliarctos is characterized by the primitive condition, and all other taxa in this analysis are characterized by the derived condition. Because Pelagiarctos does not have a complete mandible it could not be scored. Modified from character 69 of Berta and Wyss (1994).^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=29 TEXT='Paraconid cusps (=anterior cusps of Berta and Wyss, 1994) are present in most pinnipeds, and in many "imagotariine" walruses. Berta and Wyss (1994) initially considered this character to only be present in Enaliarctos and Desmatophoca, but not terrestrial arctoids, or other pinnipeds. We modified this character to represent a wider range of taxa which have well developed (but not necessarily large) paraconid cusps (state 0). Many stem odobenids exhibit minor (but distinct) paraconids (also state 0), while odobenines and dusignathines appear to lack this feature (state 1). The primitive condition is present in Pelagiarctos. Modified from character 70 of Berta and Wyss (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=30 TEXT='A smooth lingual cingulum is present in most odobenids, phocids, and some otariids (Callorhinus and some Arctophoca). In this study, a smooth lingual cingulum characterize Enaliarctos, Pteronarctos, Proneotherium, Neotherium, Pontolis, Protodobenus, and Dusignathus. A cingulum that is crenulated with small cusps is present in Imagotaria and Pelagiarctos (state 1). Crenulated lingual cingulum also occurs in some otariids.  New character.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=31 TEXT='Hypoconid cusps (occasionally referred to as posterior accessory cusps) are primitively present in most pinnipeds. Hypoconid cusps are present in "enaliarctines" and most "Imagotariinae" s. l., including Pontolis magnus. Imagotaria downsi exhibits variable presence of a hypoconid, and they are typically present on the m1 but not the p1-4 (e.g. USNM 23858). For this reason, Imagotaria was coded as possessing both states. Large hypoconids are present in Pelagiarctos. Hypoconids are lost in Dusignathus, Protodobenus, Ontocetus, and Odobenus. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=32 TEXT='The talonid basin (= posterolingual shelf of DemÃ©rÃ© and Berta, 2001) is absent in "enaliarctines" (Berta, 1991) and early "imagotariines" s.l. However, we noted that some odobenids including Pelagiarctos, Imagotaria, Kamtschatarctos, Pontolis, and Dusignathus santacruzensis exhibit a slight concavity or shelf (derived condition, state 1) on the posterolingual margin of lower postcanine teeth, which we tentatively interpret as redevelopment of a talonid basin. New Character.^n^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=33 TEXT='Although the postcanine teeth of arctoid carnivorans are primitively double-rooted (with the exception of the p1), a transition towards single-rootedness has occurred independently several times within pinnipeds, and in each case typically beginning from the anterior and progressing to the posterior postcanines (Boessenecker, 2011). Root fusion began with the p2 in otariids (Repenning and Tedford, 1977; Berta and DemÃ©rÃ©, 1986; Boessenecker, 2011), and appears to be paralled within odobenids (Mitchell, 1975; Repenning and Tedford, 1977; DemÃ©rÃ©, 1994) and desmatophocids (Mitchell, 1975). Most "imagotariinae" s. l. have a double-rooted p2. Like referred specimens of Pelagiarctos thomasi, Pelagiarctos sp. also exhibits a bilobate p2; because few other odobenid taxa possess bilobate p2, we included bilobate roots in the primitive character state. A single-rooted p2 (state 1) is present in some specimens of Imagotaria downsi, Dusignathus santacruzensis, Dusignathus seftoni, Gomphotaria, Protodobenus, Ontocetus, and Odobenus. Modified from character 6 of Berta and DemÃ©rÃ© (1986).^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=34 TEXT='As discussed in character 35 above, root fusion initiates with the p2 and progresses posteriorly. A double-rooted p3-4 is present in "enaliarctines",  Proneotherium, Neotherium, Pelagiarctos, Kamtschatarctos, and Pontolis. A single-rooted p3-4 is present Dusignathus, Gomphotaria, Protodobenus, Aivukus, Ontocetus, and Odobenus; it is present in some specimens of Imagotaria downsi, which was coded as possessing both states.

Loss of the m1 occurs within the Odobeninae, and is absent in Protodobenus, Ontocetus, Odobenus, and Valenictus. The m1 is present in "enaliarctines", all "imagotariines" s. l., Aivukus (basal Odobeninae), and all otariids and phocids. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=36 TEXT='The metaconid cusp is located on the posterior crista between the protoconid (principal cusp) and hypoconid cusp (posterior cusp), and is primitively present in pinnipeds. Berta and Wyss (1994) considered the metaconid cusp to be present in terrestrial arctoids, reduced in Enaliarctos and Pteronarctos, and absent in all later diverging pinnipeds. However, we noted that well developed metaconid cusps are present in Enaliarctos, Pteronarctos, and Proneotherium. We modified this character to reflect the variation of metaconid morphology within Pinnipedia and the Odobenidae. The metaconid is reduced (relative to Proneotherium and "enaliarctines") in Pelagiarctos, Neotherium, and Kamtschatarctos. The metaconid is lost in Imagotaria, Pontolis, Dusignathus santacruzensis, Gomphotaria, Protodobenus, Ontocetus, and Odobenus. Metaconid cusps are completely absent in all described fossil and modern otariids. Small but distinct metaconid cusps are present in Desmatophoca and many phocid seals (e.g. Phoca, Pusa, Lobodon), and absent in some (e.g. Mirounga). Modified from character 71 of Berta and Wyss (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=37 TEXT='As described above in characters 35 and 36, postcanine root fusion initiated with the p2 and progressed posteriorly, with the m1 being the last postcanine to exhibit fuse roots. A double-rooted m1 is present in "enaliarctines" and all "imagotariines" s. l., while a single-rooted m1 is present in Dusignathus spp.,  Gomphotaria, and Aivukus. Protodobenus, Ontocetus, Valenictus, and Odobenus could not be scored for this character due to the lack of an m1. Most phocid seals retain a double-rooted m1 (except for Mirounga). New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=38 TEXT='The lower second molar is primitively present and single-rooted in geologically early pinnipeds and "enaliarctines". Among odobenids, an m2 is retained in Proneotherium, Neotherium, Pontolis, Kamtschatarctos, Pelagiarctos, and some specimens of Imagotaria downsi, while it is lost in all dusignathines and odobenines. The m2 is present in Desmatophoca and Allodesmus (DemÃ©rÃ© and Berta, 2002) but is lost in all known fossil and modern otariids (except possibly Pithanotaria starri; Repenning and Tedford 1977:58).

Tooth wear is generally light or absent (state 0) in "enaliarctines", whereas apical wear (state 1) occurs in most "imagotariines" (including Pelagiarctos), Protodobenus, and Ontocetus. Two other derived states exist: the presence of large wear facets on the anterior and posterior sides of the teeth (state 2), which characterizes Pontolis and Dusignathus santacruzensis, and teeth that are worn nearly flat (state 3), which characterizes Odobenus and Gomphotaria.
