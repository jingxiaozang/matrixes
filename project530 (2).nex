        	TEXT CHARACTER=35 TEXT='Within Pinnipedia, fusion of the mandibles at the symphysis only occurs amongst walruses. Five odobenids exhibit the derived condition (a fused symphysis): Pelagiarctos thomasi, Dusignathus seftoni, Valenictus chulavistensis, Odobenus mandanoensis, and Odobenus rosmarus. Pelagiarctos sp. Dusignathus santacruzensis, and all other fossil odobenids have unfused symphyses.  Character 39 of DemÃ©rÃ©  (1994).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=36 TEXT='This character describes the length of the mandibular symphysis relative to the length of the horizontal ramus, and the derived condition constitutes mandibles with mandibular symphyses that are greater than 50% of the length of the horizontal ramus. The derived condition characterizes Dusignathus, Gomphotaria, Protodobenus, Ontocetus, Valenictus, and Odobenus. Pelagiarctos could not be scored for this character. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=37 TEXT='The presence and size of the genial tuberosity on the ventral margin of the horizontal ramus varies among pinnipeds. No apparent genial tuberosity is present in "Enaliarctines", Proneotherium, or Neotherium, while a small tubercle is present in Kamtschatarctos, Protodobenus, Valenictus, and Odobenus. In some odobenids (Pelagiarctos, Imagotaria, Pontolis, Dusignathus, and Ontocetus) the genial tuberosity is well developed and extends far below the ventral margin of the horizontal ramus. In Gomphotaria pugnax, the genial tuberosity is poorly formed and characterized by rugose ridges posterolateral to the symphysis on each dentary, and not visible in lateral view. For this reason, this character was coded as 0 for Gomphotaria. New character.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=38 TEXT='In most pinnipeds (and carnivores in general), the cortical bone surface of the entire mandible is typically smooth. However, in certain large odobenids, the anterior end of the symphyseal region of the mandibles exhibits rugose and vascularized bone with many minute foramina. This condition is present in Pelagiarctos, Pontolis, Gomphotaria, Dusignathus seftoni, Ontocetus, Valenictus chulavistensis, and Odobenus.

	TEXT CHARACTER=43 TEXT='This character relates to the position of the dorsoventrally deepest part of the horizontal ramus. In most carnivora, the dorsoventrally deepest portion of the horizontal ramus is positioned posteriorly near the P4 and M1, and likely relates to the use of enlarged carnassial teeth for mastication. The primitive condition also characterizes Enaliarctos and Pteronarctos. However, in all modern and fossil pinnipeds (sensu Berta and Wyss 1994) the deepest part of the horizontal ramus is positioned at the mandibular symphysis, and the mandible becomes deeper anteriorly towards the symphysis. This probably relates to the loss of shearing carnassial teeth and the functional transition from a masticating dentition to a pierce-feeding dentition during early pinniped evolution. Pelagiarctos (and all other odobenids) exhibit the derived condition. New character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=44 TEXT='Most pinnipeds are characterized by having mandibles that in dorsal view are nearly parallel or slightly divergent. However, some odobenids have widely divergent mandibles, likely resultant from the evolution of short and wide rostra.

A large digastric insertion also occurs in Eumetopias, Otaria, Phocarctos, and Mirounga (and some specimens of Arctocephalus pusillus).

In more derived forms, such as some odobenids and "otariine" sea lions, the lateral incisor is enlarged while the small medial incisor is positioned posteromedially; this makes the incisor alveoli appear ''V'' shaped. In Eumetopias jubatus the medial incisor is more anteriorly oriented than the lateral incisor to compensate for its posterior position, and the incisor crowns still form an arcade. "Enaliarctines" and Neotherium are characterized by the primitive condition (state 0). Pelagiarctos exhibits lateral incisors with roots that are only slightly wider than medial incisors, but the medial incisors are posteriorly positioned (state 1). Imagotaria, Dusignathus santacruzensis, Ontocetus, and Protodobenus exhibit the derived condition (state 1); Proneotheriium, Kamtschatarctos, Dusignathus seftoni, Gomphotaria, Valenictus, and Odobenus could not be coded for this character because of the lack of preserved incisors or well preserved alveoli, loss of medial incisors, or loss of both lower incisors.

Reduction of lower canine size occurs within Protodobenus, Ontocetus, and Odobenus, which possess state 1 (a lower canine that is less than 75% of the width of the upper canine). Further reduction occurs in Valenictus, which has lost the lower canine (state 2). Although upper canines are unknown for Pelagiarctos, its lower canine is caniniform and thus represents the primitive condition. Modified from characters 28 and 31 of DemÃ©rÃ© (1994).';

A new specimen of Dusignathus seftoni also lacks a posterior crista, and so does Pontolis magnus; in these taxa, this is related to the enlargement and tusk-like development of the lower canines. However, we note that a posterior crista is also absent in odobenines such as Protodobenus, Ontocetus, and Odobenus. Pelagiarctos, "enaliarctines", Proneotherium, Neotherium, and Imagotaria all exhibit the primitive condition. New character.';

Berta and Wyss (1994) originally considered only Pteronarctos, Callorhinus, and Otaria to exhibit the derived condition, but Adam and Berta (2002) noted that the m1 is positioned anteriorly to the halfway point of the mandible in Pteronarctos and all later diverging pinnipediforms (but not Enaliarctos). We measured postcanine tooth length and mandible length. Enaliarctos has a tooth row 49% of the mandible length, while all other pinnipedimorph taxa have a toothrow < 40% of the mandible length (~25% in Ontocetus as the shortest, and 36% in Proneotherium as the longest).
