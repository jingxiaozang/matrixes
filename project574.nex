        	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='These states roughly correspond to low, intermediate, and high tooth count in mosasaurs, respectively.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=9 TEXT='The maximum length to maximum width ratio of 1.5:1 or smaller characterizes the state (0), that of about 2:1 characterizes the state (1).^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=10 TEXT='In the state (2), the distance between two anterolateral processes is greater than 50% of interorbital distance. In Tylosaurus kansasensis, while appearing to possess broad anterior narial embayment of the frontal, the distance between the two processes is less than half the interorbital width and hence here scored for the state 1.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=20 TEXT='In state (0), the maximum dimension of the foramen is typically 25% or less than the maximum parietal table width, while in state (1), it ranges between 25% and one-third the parietal table width. In state (2), the maximum (= longitudinal) dimension of foramen clearly exceeds one-third the maximum parietal table width.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=21 TEXT='In states (2) and (3), the ratio is typically greater than 1.6.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=23 TEXT='In state (3), the degree of dorsal exposure ranges from very thin to approximately half the longitudinal dimension of the adjacent frontal ala.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=24 TEXT='Terminology from Bahl (1937:142).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=25 TEXT='In state (0), a small, wedge-shaped concavity may exist at the posteromedial corner of the wing for receiving a short parietal postorbital process.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=30 TEXT='Although not scored due to incomplete preservation of the specimens, the three post-middle Campanian species of Plioplatecarpus likely exhibit the ascending ramus length being clearly more than 50% horizontal ramus length (state [2]).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=34 TEXT='This character based on Bell''s (1997) definition in general differentiates derived russellosaurines from mosasaurines.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=37 TEXT='State (4) is unique to Ectenosaurus.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=47 TEXT='In Plioplatecarpus primaevus, the tubera exhibit less inflation than in the other taxa scored for the state (3).';

	TEXT CHARACTER=59 TEXT='A very low coronoid profile results from state (2).^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=71 TEXT='In state (0), there are seldom nine pygal vertebrae.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=84 TEXT='The preceding statements on absence/presence and size comparison of these carpal elements are based on large and presumably fully matured specimens of representative taxa, and thought to preclude any ontogenetic considerations.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=86 TEXT='As above, the data come from large (mature) specimens.';

	TEXT CHARACTER=91 TEXT='In Plioplatecarpus marshi and P. houzeaui, both morphs seem to occur on the same individual or intraspecifically.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=93 TEXT='These angles were measured along the long axis of the tooth base (i.e., exposed root portion) and basal portion of the crown, not the posteriorly recurved distal portion of the latter.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=97 TEXT='Some specimens of cf. Platecarpus tympaniticus (e.g., YPM 4025; 40671) show that the canal is anteriorly separated by median septum while it is bilobate at its posterior exit on medullary floor. Therefore, the scoring of this character is based on morphology of the canal at its posterior exit when such a fact is known.^n';
