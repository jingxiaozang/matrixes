        [Character comments]
        	TEXT CHARACTER=1 TEXT='The facial stripes are present as two lines on each side of the face. The dorsomedial stripe begins at the posterolateral edge of the noseleaf, continues above the eye, and terminates close to the pinna. The ventrolateral stripe begins in the corner of the mouth and runs toward the tragus. The facial stripes are present in all the species of Platyrrhinus, Vampyrodes caraccioli, and Uroderma magnirostrum. In contrast the facial stripes are absent in Carollia subrufa and Sturnira erythromos. Owen (1987: character 4) uses the facial stripes as part of a multistate character that he termed "Pelage patterns." In this character Owen includes facial stripes, dorsal stripe, shoulders patches, and striping on the wing. I agree with Owen on his facial stripes scoring for the species used in the present analysis. Lim (1993: character 1) and Wetterer et al. (2000: character 6) include facial stripes in their phylogenetic analyses; character states and scoring used in this analysis coincide with theirs.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=2 TEXT='In most Platyrrhinus species, both facial stripes have the same tonality, either dark or brilliant (e.g., P. aurarius, P helleri "Eastern," P. nigellus). In contrast, P. vittatus "Northern" and P. vittatus "Southern" have a more luminous dorsomedial stripe. Carollia subrufa and Sturnira erythromos were scored as "-," because they do not have facial stripes. This is the first use of this character in a phylogenetic analysis.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='The facial stripes are brilliant or white in P. brachycephalus, P. helleri "Eastern," P. helleri "Western," P. lineatus P. recifinus, P. vittatus "Southern," Vampyrodes caraccioli, and Uroderma magnirostrum. In contrast, they are dark in P. aurarius, P. chocoensis, P. dorsalis, P. dorsalis "Norte," P. dorsalis "Centro-Sur," P. infuscus, P. nigellus, and P. vittatus "Northern." Carollia subrufa and Sturnira erythromos were scored as "-" because they lack both facial stripes. This is the first use of this character in a phylogenetic analysis.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='The genal vibrissae are implanted in the cheek, ventral or/and posterior to the eye. The genal vibrissae are present in all the species of Platyrrhinus. These vibrissae are implanted in a basal protuberance in some Platyrrhinus (e.g., P. brachycephalus, P. helleri "Eastern," P. lineatus; Fig. 3A). In contrast, the genal vibrissae are implanted directly on the cheek in Carollia subrufa and some species of Platyrrhinus (e.g., P. aurarius, P. chocoensis; Fig. 3B-C). This character has not been used in previous studies.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='Some species of Platyrrhinus have seven vibrissae surrounding the margins of the noseleaf in a single array (e.g., P. brachycephalus, P. chocoensis, P. lineatus) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, six vibrissae are presented to each side of the noseleaf in some Platyrrhinus and Vampyrodes (e.g., P. aurarius, P. dorsalis; Fig. 3A). Platyrrhinus helleri "Eastern" presents intraspecific variation (seven and eight vibrissae present; Fig. 3B-C). Sturnira erythromos have nine vibrissae surrounding the margins of the noseleaf.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='In some species of Platyrrhinus (e.g., P. aurarius, P. chocoensis, P. dorsalis), Sturnira erythromos, Uroderma magnirostrum, and Vampyrodes a single vibrissa is present on the upper lip, ventral to the vibrissae that surround the margins of the noseleaf (Fig. 3A). Only P. brachycephalus and Carollia subrufa have two vibrissae on the upper lip (Fig. 3B). Platyrrhinus helleri "Eastern," P. infuscus, and P. nigellus present intraspecific variation in this character (one vibrissa and two vibrissae present) (Fig. 3A-B). This character has not been used in any other study.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=7 TEXT='The submental vibrissae are on the chin and lower lip, and are usually arranged in two notable parallel longitudinal rows (Pocock, 1914; Brown, 1971). Some Platyrrhinus (e.g., P. aurarius, P. lineatus, P. nigellus), Uroderma magnirostrum, and Vampyrodes (Fig. 4C, E) always have four submental vibrissae. Platyrrhinus dorsalis "Centro-Sur" has two submental vibrissae (Fig. 4B). Platyrrhinus brachycephalus present five submental vibrissae (Fig. 4D). Intraspecific variation was noted (three and four submental vibrissae) in P. chocoensis (Fig. 4A, C, E). Carollia subrufa lacks submental vibrissae. This character has not been used in previous studies.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=8 TEXT='The interramal vibrissae form a median tuft on the gular region between the two rami of the lower jaws and well behind the mandibular symphysis (Pocock, 1914; Brown, 1971). Platyrrhinus recifinus, Sturnira erythromos, and Uroderma magnirostrum lack interramal vibrissae (Fig. 4A). An interramal vibrissa is present in some species of Platyrrhinus (e.g., P. brachycephalus, P. lineatus), and Vampyrodes (Fig. 4B-D). Two interramal vibrissae are present in P. infuscus, P. vittatus "Northern," P. helleri "Western," and Carollia subrufa (Fig. 4E). Intraspecific variation is found in P. vittatus "Southern" (one and two interramal vibrissae present; Fig. 4B-E). This character was used by Wetterer et al. (2000: character 13).^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=9 TEXT='The inferior border of the horseshoe is completely free of the upper lip in some Platyrrhinus (e.g., P. brachycephalus, P. lineatus), Uroderma magnirostrum, and Vampyrodes (Fig. 5C). Platyrrhinus chocoensis, P. dorsalis "Centro-Sur," and P. infuscus have intraspecific variation (inferior border completely free and partially joined; Fig. 5B-C). In Carollia subrufa and Sturnira erythromos, there is no distinct boundary between horseshoe and the upper lip (Fig. 5A). According to Wetterer et al. (2000: character 25), the inferior border is completely free in all the species of Platyrrhinus, however, I do not agree with that assessment.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=10 TEXT='Sturnira erythromos lacks these folds (Fig. 3C). The folds in the pinna are not very well defined in some species of Platyrrhinus (e.g., P. dorsalis, P. lineatus, P. recifinus) and Vampyrodes (Fig. 3B). In contrast, P. aurarius, P. chocoensis, P. dorsalis "Centro-Sur," P. nigellus, P. vittatus "Northern," Carollia subrufa, and Uroderma magnirostrum have well marked pinna folds (Fig. 3A). Platyrrhinus helleri "Eastern" and P. infuscus present intraspecific variation, presenting both states (Fig. 3A-B). This is the first use of this character in a phylogenetic analysis.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=11 TEXT='A dorsal midline stripe is absent in Carollia subrufa and Sturnira erythromos. A narrow dorsal stripe is presented in some species of Platyrrhinus (e.g., P. chocoensis, P. dorsalis) and Uroderma magnirostrum. Platyrrhinus lineatus, P. recifinus, P. vittatus "Northern," P. vittatus "Southern," and Vampyrodes have the dorsal stripe that is white and wide. In Platyrrhinus infuscus the dorsal stripe is thin and obscure. Platyrrhinus brachycephalus, P. helleri "Eastern," and P. nigellus all show intraspecific variation in this character, some individuals with a narrow dorsal stripe and others with white and wide stripes. Owen (1987: character 4) used the dorsal stripe as part of a complex multistate character termed "Pelage patterns," in which he included facial stripes, dorsal stripe, and shoulder patches. I agree with Owen (1987) on the scores for dorsal stripe in the species used in the present analysis. Wetterer et al. (2000: character 7) used the dorsal stripe as a character with three states: absent, present, and occassionally present.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=12 TEXT='Dorsal fur is of average length in some species of Platyrrhinus (e.g., P. helleri "Eastern," P. recifinus), Carollia subrufa, Uroderma magnirostrum, and Vampyrodes. In Platyrrhinus aurarius, P. dorsalis, P. dorsalis "Norte," P. nigellus, P. vittatus "Northern," P. vittatus "Southern," and Sturnira erythromos, the dorsal fur is long. Platyrrhinus infuscus characteristically has short dorsal fur. Platyrrhinus chocoensis presents intraspecific variation, in which some individuals have short dorsal fur and while in others it is normal.
