        	TEXT CHARACTER=1 TEXT='The number of antennal segments varies significantly from 2 to 9 segments; with reduced, 2-segmented antennae occurring^nin the ground-dwelling Acropygorthezia williamsi. Most genera have a constant number of segments, except for Newsteadia where it can vary from 3 to 7 segments.^n^nNB: there has been a confusion in character state labelling. The paper writes: States: 0 = two; 1 = three; 2 = four; 3 = five; 4 = six; 5 = seven; 6 = eight; 7 = nine.^n^nBut the actual coding found in the supplemental information and present matrix is as follows.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=2 TEXT='Newsteadia spp. all have a significantly larger and longer first segment than the other antennal segments. This feature is characteristic of the genus (Miller & KozÂ´ar, 2002).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='Koteja (1974a) studied the significance of labium morphology and hypothesized a reduction of labium segmentation across lineages of Coccoidea. In the Ortheziidae and selected outgroups, the number of segments varies from one to two segments. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='All Ortheziidae have the labium bearing mainly hair-like setae. The Ortheziolinae are characterized by the presence of 3 setae inserted on one basal socket (Koz"¡r, 2004). ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='The presence of stiff setae on the 2nd segment is a probably a diagnostic feature of Burmorthezia. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='Cephalic plate on dorsal surface of head: This feature is present and diagnostic of Praelongorthezia. "''Sclerotic plates"'' (Koz"¡r, 2004: 318) are present in Insignorthezia pseudinsignis but appear different in shape and are represented in two rows on the head.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=7 TEXT='Most of female Coccoidea have one tarsal segment although a few families can have two (usually the first tarsal segment is reduced), as in one selected outgroup, Matsucoccus gallicolus';
	TEXT CHARACTER=8 TEXT='Some genera possess an additional structure on the antenna called the pseudobasal segment, which occurs at the base of the 1st segment. It is identified relative to the position of the 2nd segment, which bears the Johnston"''s organ. In some genera the pseudobasal segment fuses the eyestalk with the antenna (e.g., Orthezioliinae). A few species that have this segment also have the eye separated from the antenna (e.g., Mixortheziini and Nipponortheziini)';
	TEXT CHARACTER=9 TEXT='Fusion of the eye to the antennal base is found in some genera and is generally accompanied by the presence of the pseudobasal segment';
	TEXT CHARACTER=10 TEXT='The family Ortheziidae is defined traditionally in part by large, differentiated setae on the apex and subapex of the terminal segment. All extant members of the family possess differentiated setae, as opposed to the fossil ortheziids in Cretaceous amber, and our outgroups, which lack them.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=11 TEXT='When there is a differentiated apical seta on the last antennal segment, the seta can be short especially in the Ortheziinae and long in the rest of the Ortheziidae^nWhen the differenciation is absent, the character is coded as NA.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=12 TEXT='In addition to the seta, the apical seta varies in type. There can be a stout type (usually short) and a fleshy type (usually long). ^nWhen apical seta absent, the character is coded as NA';
	TEXT CHARACTER=13 TEXT='^n^nA sensory seta is often present on the apical segment as a stout seta with a rounded, blunt tip. It can also be long, slender, and tapered. Usually, the shorter sensory seta is found in genera that also bear a short, stout apical seta';
	TEXT CHARACTER=14 TEXT='^nExcluding the flagellate sensory seta, and the apical and subapical setae, all others on the antenna are the unspecialized setae. They are usually the same shape along the antenna but vary in number among segments and genera. Usually the 1st and 2nd segments bear fewer setae.^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=16 TEXT='^n^nThe apical seta usually is accompanied by a subapical one, and is longer than the unspecialized setae';
	TEXT CHARACTER=17 TEXT='^n^nLength of segment is variable across the family. If there are more antennal segments, the 1st or 2nd one tends to be the longest; with fewer segments (3 to 6), one of the segments becomes the longest one. This suggests that loss of segments involves the fusion of some intermediate segments';
	TEXT CHARACTER=18 TEXT='^n^nThe proportions of the 1st segment vary across the family and can be informative for generic identification. In Newsteadia, it is usually longer than wide; in Orthezia it is nearly square';
	TEXT CHARACTER=19 TEXT='^n^nMost ortheziids possess a straight antennal segment; a few possess curved ones, which can be informative for identification although this state is not characteristic of one group';
	TEXT CHARACTER=20 TEXT='^n^nThe shape of the apical segment occurs in two states; genera with long apical setae tend to have the apical segment slightly clavate, as opposed to genera possessing a short, stout apical seta, which tend to have a terminal segment of uniform thickness';
	TEXT CHARACTER=21 TEXT='^n^na minute microseta can occur at the tip of the antenna adjacent to the apical seta. Although not exclusive of one group, Mixorthezinii bear obvious microsetae and Neomixorthezia has characteristic microsetae with tips that are slightly blunt. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=22 TEXT='^n^nIn the Ortheziidae, antennal structure seems to correlate with the number of undifferentiated setae. For instance, antennae with short, stout apical setae always have very few undifferentiated setae.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=23 TEXT='^n^nMorrison (1925) illustrated well the diversity of eye shape in the Ortheziidae. Two types of eyes are defined here: a sessile eye (Fig 11E), a stalked, protruding eye (Fig 11F). ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=24 TEXT='^n^nIn those families of Coccoidea that have well-developed legs, the femur and trochanter are separated. In the Ortheziidae, the femur and trochanter are fused except for Arctorthezia. Species from the Cretaceous possess an (assumed plesiomorphic) unfused femur and trochanter.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=25 TEXT='Within the Ortheziidae, the tibia and tarsus either can be fully separated, in which case the tibia is larger in diameter than the tarsus; or largely be fused but with a fine suture between the segments; or completely fused, in which the tibia and tarsus can be delineated only by the presence of a sensory seta and/or sensory pore at the limit between the tibia and tarsus';
	TEXT CHARACTER=26 TEXT='When not fused, an articulation is fully developed between the tibia and tarsus. In this analysis it applies only to the outgroup taxa.^n^n^nThis character only applies to unfused tibia and tarsus. When fused, the character is coded as NA';
	TEXT CHARACTER=27 TEXT='^n^nWhen the tibia and tarsus are separated fully, a pair of long, stout spines is present on the ventral side of the leg.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=28 TEXT='^n^nIn other coccoid families the tibia is usually longer than the tarsus. In the Ortheziidae, two trends are observed: the Orthezia-like genera, in which the tibia is longer than the tarsus, and the Newsteadia-like genera, with the tarsus longer than the tibia. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=29 TEXT='^n^nThe digitule is a seta-like structure inserted at the base of the claw. In the Ortheziidae they can be spine-like or hair-like.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=30 TEXT='^n^nThe claw ventrally can bear small teeth called denticles. One or more may be present';
	TEXT CHARACTER=31 TEXT='^nSetae are present always on the tibia and tarsus, which can be all spine-like (spiniform) or all hair-like (setiform), but in some species they are setiform except for spiniform setae on the ventral side of the tarsus^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=33 TEXT='^n^nSetae on the tibia and tarsus are arranged in rows, which can vary in number';
	TEXT CHARACTER=34 TEXT='^n^nThe trochanter always possesses 3 or 4 sensory pores basally';
	TEXT CHARACTER=35 TEXT='^nThis seta is usually present even when the tibia and tarsus are fully fused, with or without a fine suture delineating them. As such, the sensory seta along with the sensory pore (character 26) allows delineating the tibia from the tarsus^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=36 TEXT='^n^nThis sensory pore is present at the proximal end of the tibia.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=37 TEXT='^nThe coxa usually bears a few setae of the same type as found on the trochanter and femur, but in some cases additionally it can have distinctly short, stout spines (e.g. Newsteadia monikae). ^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=38 TEXT='^n^nEven within the genus Newsteadia, the labium shape can vary significantly (Koz"¡r, 2004: 32). In the family, the apex of the labium can be narrow or broad.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=39 TEXT='^nThese are conical pores found in clusters around the anal ring (Koz"¡r & Miller, 2000). ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=40 TEXT='^n^nThese pores are characteristic of the family and form tube-like or pore-like structures with four loculi and can vary in detailed structure (Koz"¡r, 2004). On the dorsal surface, they occur among the wax spines';
	TEXT CHARACTER=41 TEXT='^nThese pores are found specifically in the Pseudococcidae and Putoidae and are defined by pores with three loculi arrangement in a swirled manner and produce the wax';
	TEXT CHARACTER=42 TEXT='In the Newsteadiinae, tubular ducts are found among the wax spine lobes, but they are possibly modified quadrilocular pores that have become extended in length.^nThey are very likely not homologous to the tubular ducts found in other families such as the Pseudococcidae or Coccidae. ^nThe tubular ducts of Newsteadia do not have invaginated ductules and are found among the wax spines^n^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=43 TEXT='The adult female ortheziid is recognizable by its large ovisac, in which the eggs and/or nymphs are brooded. On a microscopic level, the presence of the ovisac is obvious by the presence of an ovisac band on the ventral surface of the abdomen, delineated by a thick line of wax spines. The band is generally not visible in amber specimens, since the surface is obscured by wax, although the ovisac can be macroscopically obvious. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=44 TEXT='In most ortheziids, the inner surface of the ovisac band possesses rows of spines.  In some cases these are absent (e.g. most Newsteadia species). When the ovisac band is absent, the characters is coded as NA';
	TEXT CHARACTER=45 TEXT='The inner surface of the ovisac also bears simple and multilocular pores. For the multilocular pores, the number of loculi varies';
	TEXT CHARACTER=54 TEXT='^n^nThe abdominal spiracles can be present on the ventral or dorsal surface. In some genera, they are present on both surfaces, anterior abdominal spiracles being on the ventral surface and last two posterior abdominal spiracles found on the dorsal surface (e.g. Orthezia spp.). ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=55 TEXT='^n^nOn the dorsum, wax lobes can cover the whole surface, which is the case for instance in Arctorthezia spp. In other cases, the dorsal wax lobes do not completely cover the dorsum. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=57 TEXT='When submedial dorsal wax lobes are absent, the character is coded as non applicable';
	TEXT CHARACTER=58 TEXT='^n^nCircular pore clusters: The clusters of pores (Morrison, 1952) are found on the dorsal surface at the upper corners of the marginal plates, separating the submedian and marginal plates. This feature is characteristic of Arctorthezia pseudoccidentalis but was discovered also in Arctorthezia baltica Vea & Grimaldi sp.n. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=59 TEXT='^n^nWax secretion on the venter is usually present as plates of secretion rather than lobes. In some cases it doesn"''t completely cover the surface. For mounted specimens, wax presence was coded through the distribution of wax spine plates.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=60 TEXT='The number of marginal wax lobes varies across the Ortheziidae. The count here was made by including the frontal and posterior marginal lobes. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=61 TEXT='^nThe median wax plates are often fused to the submedian plates but sometimes they are absent, resulting in a medial naked area on the dorsum. Here, the median wax plates have been distinguished from the midline asymmetrical wax lobes found in Arctorthezia^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=62 TEXT='In Arctorthezia, a triplet of triangular or shield shaped wax lobes are present on the dorsum of the thoracic segments. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=63 TEXT='^n^nPores of different types can be present around the thoracic spiracles. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=65 TEXT='^nWax covering was not used in this study except for the orientation of some anterior wax lobes that are inclined anteriad, a distinctive feature of the genus Newsteadia. Access to more fresh and/or dry material would enable a comparison of wax coverings with the fossil specimens. Photographs of specimens in their natural state would be the most informative since the wax covering is damaged when the specimen is conserved dry or in alcohol';
	TEXT CHARACTER=66 TEXT='the Ortheziidae and other families (e.g. Pseudococcidae) have an anal ring often bearing 3 pairs of setae and secretion pores. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=67 TEXT='the length of setae on the anal ring varies according to genera. Some genera have relatively short setae, which are usually spine-like (e.g. Newsteadia) and the genera with long setae will be hair-like or fleshy (e.g. Orthezia). ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=68 TEXT='the lateral pair of setae on the anal ring are usually of the same length as the anterior and posterior setae but in the Nipponortheziini, the lateral pair is at least half the size of the other setae and hair-like as opposed to spine-like';
	TEXT CHARACTER=69 TEXT='in Ortheziolinae the anterior portion of the anal ring has a sclerotized cuticular plate, which seems to be characteristic of this subfamily.';
