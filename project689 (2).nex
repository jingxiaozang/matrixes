The question of whether or not the ancient asexual Darwinuloidea ever had a Zenker''s Organ is controversial; only a single rare male record of an extant darwinuloidean exists (see Martens 1998, for discussion) and we do not accept Maddocks'' (1973) interpretation of the original illustrations as showing Zenker''s Organs to be present. In the absence of evidence to the contrary it is most parsimonious to score this character as absent in darwinuloideans.';

	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='Horne 06^nPhosphatocopina were once considered to have only a proximal movable endite on the basis, not a true coxa, in antenna and mandibula.

	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='Horne 09^nIn considering the number of rays on the maxillular branchial plate, it is necessary to use overlapping ranges in order to allow for the variation seen within the various groups, but the ranges themselves have been chosen to reflect natural groupings in which most taxa are centred on "''typical"'' values (Smith et al. in press). Thus, while the number of branchial plate rays in Cytheroidea ranges from 10-29, most cytheroideans have, typically, 15-17 rays, while those with more than 20 belong to the families Entocytheridae and Bythocytheridae, which are arguably more ancient in origin. In character state 1, we group the Cytheroidea, Cypridoidea (16-27 rays), Pontocypridoidea (15-25 rays), Sigillioidea (17 rays), Macrocypridoidea (16-18 rays) and Terrestricytheroidea (20 rays).

Other taxa possess epipodites on trunk limbs, and are scored here (notably Malacostraca and Branchiopoda) after Wills et al. (1998; despite those scorings being for the 8th limb, the 6th and 8th are both tagmatized as thoracic limbs and hence considered together here).

	TEXT CHARACTER=20 TEXT='Perez-Losada char 12^nOccurrence of rostrolaterals in the wall of shell plates. We must express considerable doubt regarding the traditional homology scheme when comparing lateral plates in scalpelloids and verrucomorphs with those in balanomorphs. Cirripedologists generally agree that a scalpelloid such as Pollicz$es possess both CL, L, and RL (characters 10, 12, 13). However, our Figure 1A clearly illustrates that the plates bearing these names may often deviate little, if at all, in special morphology and size from the remaining and largely anonymous imbricating plates. Thus the homology seems based principally on the criterion of position, although assisted by some evidence from ontogeny and comparison to OTUs such as Neolepas. Proverrucu ? and Eocerrucu Jr possess two large plates in a lateral position, which the traditional interpretation (Newman et al., 1969) considers as CL and RL. However, this has come to seem doubtful since the putatively more plesiomorphic member of the verrucomorph clade, Neoverruca, has a median latus (L) but no dedicated carinolatera (CL) or rostrolatera (RL). We do not want to build our interpretations on preconceived ideas of phylogeny, so we examined the possible homologies between the lateral plates in Proverrucu ? and Eoverruca ? and those in either balanomorphs or scalpelloids. This reveals^nthat we cannot reject the possibility that the plate overlapping the rostrum (R) in Prouerruca? and Eoverrucap may, positionally, be an RL, but it cannot be an L. We therefore code these two OTUs as 13(1). The other plate, however, overlapped by the one just mentioned and itself overlapping the carina, could either be an L or a CL. We therefore code Proverruca? and Eoverrucut as 12(?); (see Fig. 1).';

The anterior doublure is usually mared by terrace lines running subparallel to the margin of the cephalon. A soft, ventral membrane was attached to the inner edge of the reflexed margin in life and ran to the bases of the appendages.

The general morphology of the myodocopan maxillulae is typically quite different from that of podocopans, with the endopodite very short and compact although up to three podomeres may be discernable (Horne et al. 2003).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=142 TEXT='Horne 11^nWhether ostracod branchial plates (which may occur on mandibula, maxillula, fifth limb and sixth limb) are exopodites or epipodites has been the subject of controversy in the literature (see, e.g., Cohen et al. 1998). Schram (1986: 401), apparently favouring phylogenetic hypothesis over morphological evidence, argued that they are exopodites because "to use the term epipod would imply an independent evolution of such a specialised exite in the ostracodes". Schram & Hoff (1998), in an analysis of the major crustacean groups utilising 90 characters, scored Ostracoda as having no epipodal development on the fifth limb. Myodocopans lack a maxillular branchial plate, but Boxshall (1997) has demonstrated that their fifth and sixth limb branchial plates are epipodites. Horne (in press) has concluded that the podocopan maxillular branchial plate is not an epipodite, as some authors have argued, but an exopodite arising from an undifferentiated protopodite. In adult myodocopans the maxillular exopodite is reduced to a single podomere, but in at least some Cladocopoidea there is a suggestion of a subdivision, seen more clearly in early instars and perhaps a vestige o the plesiomorphic multisegmented state (see Horne 2005, for discussion).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=143 TEXT='Horne 12^nThe homology of the podocopan fifth limb is one of the most significant and contentious issues in ostracod phylogeny. For the purposes of the present study, we have assumed that for all of the fifth limb characters used, the fifth limb is homologous in all taxa analysed. We note, however, the view of some authors that, in podocopans at least, the true fifth limb (the posterior-most crustacean head limb, the maxilla) is missing and the so-called fifth limb is in fact the first thoracic limb (and therefore a homologue of the sixth limb in other Crustacea); see, e.g., Smith & Martens (2000), Horne et al. (2002) and Horne (2005). If that view were to be accepted, it would follow that none of the post-maxillular limbs could automatically be regarded as homologous. Here, we adopt the view that the fifth limb in all the analysed taxa is homologous, but consider that in Podocopa (as in Phosphatocopina and Martinssonia) it is the anterior-most trunk limb, not the hindmost head limb. In other words, unlike in other crown-group crustaceans, the maxillary segment in podocopans has not been encephalised (for further discussion see remarks on character 26). This interpretation allows us to consider fifth (and subsequent) limbs as homologous without contradicting the evidence that in podocopans they are trunk limbs; as such it is an operational compromise, but one which is not inconsistent with at least some phylogenetic scenarios (see Horne 2005, for discussion).^nA fifth limb endopodite is present in males only of the Cytherelloidea (this state being scored here) while in females the limb comprises only the protopodite and exopodite. Myodocopan fifth limbs are very complex and so extensively modified and shortened as to make the identification of rami and the determination of the number of podomeres extremely difficult (see, e.g., Kornicker, 2002), hence the use of the term "compacted".';
