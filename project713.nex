        [Character comments]
        	TEXT CHARACTER=1 TEXT='The character states outlined by Upchurch et al. (in press) do not easily accommodate the distinctive skull morphologies of Nemegtosaurus or Rapetosaurus,  so the category "platalean" has been added here to describe their distinctive snouts. The otherwise superficially diplodocoid-like morphology of these taxa is almost certainly convergent given the peculiar morphology of the primitive titanosaur Malawisaurus and the Brachiosaurus brancai-like titanosaur skulls from the Bajo Barreal Formation of South America (Lamanna et al., 2001).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=2 TEXT='Character 2 of Wilson (2002) is somewhat confusing because it obfuscates important anatomical details; the anatomical relationships Wilson intended to encompass in his character have been separated into several distinct characters by Upchurch et al. (in press). The "caudolateral process" of the premaxilla is most distinct in taxa (e.g., Euhelopus, Omeisaurus, Shunosaurus) in which the caudal part of the premaxilla bifurcates to house the rostral margin of the external nares. The caudolateral process is the prong or point at the rostroventral most edge of the external nares. By his use of this character, Wilson (2002) clearly accepts that all sauropods retain a "caudolateral" process, but Upchurch et al. (in press) cite as their character 15 the possibility that the process is absent -- indeed, they code it as absent for all sauropods for which this element could be coded except the aforementioned taxa plus Jobaria.  As a result, the caudal migration of the external nares produced one of two effects: the caudolateral process ceased to exist as a distinct process, or the process fused to the nasal process. Wilson (2002) favors the former interpretation because in the taxa he codes as showing the derived state, there is no distinct process. What occurs instead, however, is that the sutures between the portion of the premaxilla excepting the nasal process (which is the indistinct "caudolateral process") and the rostromedial portion of the maxilla of the left and right sides meet at the midline within the external narial fossa and/or fenestra.  Thus, as used here, this character subsumes character 2 of Wilson (2002) and character 15 of Upchurch et al. (in press). Retraction of the nares clearly created a complex set of mutually inclusive states (e.g., characters 3-8, 13, etc.); further discoveries will help determine if they should continue to be coded separately.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='This character has been modified from Upchurch et al. (in press), which did not specify at point along the midline from which the angle should be measured. The character is clearly intended to describe the unique condition in diplodocoids, induced by the extreme caudal retraction of the external nares (see character 2) and the mediolateral narrowing of the premaxilla. The caudomedial portion of the premaxilla-maxilla suture in non-diplodocoids, however, also closely parallels the midline suture, while it is the rostrolateral part that is at the widely divergent angle, so it is that region that is specified here.  The angle is measured between the projection of the line defined by the rostrolateral end of the premaxilla-maxilla suture and the skull midline in dorsal view. The derived character states are probably inextricably linked to the rostrocaudal elongation and mediolateral narrowing of the premaxilla (character 12 of Upchurch et al. [in press]) since any lateral migration of the rostral end of the premaxilla (independent of the nasal process) that creates a wider angle also creates the distinction defined therein; any simultaneous lateral widening of the ascending process maintains the derived low angle.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='Another way to phrase this character may be to state that the rostral and dorsal margins of the premaxilla, seen particularly in lateral view, lie in different planes: the dorsal margin approaches horizontal whereas the rostral margin is near vertical.  The derived state appears in sauropods with "diplodocoid"-type skulls in which the dorsal margin of the skull is more or less linear in lateral view.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='Upchurch et al. (in press) clearly erected this character to distinguish the distinctive, sinuous conjoined nasal processes of the premaxilla that form the internarial bar in taxa such as Brachiosaurus brancai. The character has been slightly modified here to specify the "free" portion of the conjoined processes (the parts that are bordered laterally only by space in the external narial opening), because without that caveat, some of the ascending process bordered laterally by the maxilla could be viewed as having an orientation other than that specified in the coded state.';

	TEXT CHARACTER=12 TEXT='Wilson (2002) included this character as part of what is here character 2, implying that the narial fossa is created solely by the midline contact of the premaxilla and maxilla.  However, it is conceivable that such a structure could exist but not be restricted to specific elements -- other cranial openings, such as the supratemporal fenestrae, show different osteological associations throughout sauropodomorph evolution, so there is no a priori reason to make such a restriction.  This character is thus retained here separately, following Upchurch (1998) and Upchurch et al. (in press).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=14 TEXT='Wilson (2002) did not specify a specific portion of the external narial opening that acts as a reference for its relative position to the antorbital fenestra.  Upchurch et al.

The character is simplified here.';

Some sauropod teeth (particularly those spatulate ones with V-shaped wear facets) do not undergo substantial cross-sectional morphological change as a result of wear, but diplodocoids in particular have teeth with somewhat spatulate tips (either elliptical or D-shaped in cross section) in newly erupted teeth that are worn completely away during use, producing the characteristic subcircular cross-sectional morphology.';

Whether these taxa shared a common ancestor with tall spines that only later became bifid in dicraeosaurids remains to be seen.';

	TEXT CHARACTER=143 TEXT='The following discussion pertains to both prespinal (character 143) and postspinal (character 144 laminae and associated spinozygapophyseal laminae; for the sake of discussion, the artificial term "median lamina" is used to denote both prespinal and postspinal laminae and "spinozygapophyseal laminae" is used to include both cranial and caudal variants. These characters are elaborated from the states listed by Wilson (2002) and Upchurch et al. (in press) by specifying the nature of any relationship between the median and spinozygapophyseal laminae.  In sauropods that lack the a median lamina but possess spinozygapophyseal laminae, the region between the latter generally forms a moderately deep interspinal ligament fossa, as in birds.  When the two laminae are connected, it usually manifests by the merging of proximally separate spinozygapophyseal laminae to form a single, median lamina, though the position of the bifurcation varies across taxa.  In some cases (e.g., Apatosaurus [Gilmore, 1936: pl. 25, fig. 8]), although the laminae merge distally, the median lamina maintains a separate offshoot proximally between the spinozygapophyseal laminae.  Apatosaurus is currently unique in possessing at least one vertebra (Gilmore, 1936: pl. 25, fig. 9) character state 4, although in that specimen the spinozygapophyseal laminae do not persist far distally. To allow the possible evolution of both states 1 and 2 from state 0, this character is unordered. (cont''d in char. 143)';
	TEXT CHARACTER=144 TEXT='(cont''d from character 141) It should be acknowledged that there are serious problems with characters concerning the median laminae and the spinozygapophyseal laminae.  As is evident here, many sauropods possess a single midline structure that is superficially like a median lamina that bifurcates toward its proximal end into what would be considered spinozygapophyseal laminae.  However, it is impossible to tell in such a configuration whether or not the median lamina is a separate and distinct entity that simply merges with the spinozygapophyseal laminae or whether it is composed entirely of conjoined spinozygapophyseal laminae.  This is problematic because it is then impossible to ascertain whether or not a median lamina formed only by spinozygapophyseal laminae is homologous to the median lamina of some taxa that is unconnected to the zygapophyses, despite the fact that they receive identical names and codings.  Although they are retained here, future analyses will require further analysis and possible restructuring of these characters to address this issue.  Conceivably, the fact that different vertebrae within a given individual of some taxa display different states may render these characters phylogenetically useless.';

	TEXT CHARACTER=174 TEXT='In some taxa (e.g., Dicraeosaurus), "contact" is loosely defined.  In this taxon, the cranial spinozygapophyseal lamina is larger than its caudal counterpart and forms a prominent, laterally-projecting lateral spinal lamina.  The caudal spinozygapophyseal lamina, in contrast, weakens progressively to terminate near or at the distal margin of the aforementioned lateral lamina.  On some vertebrae, the caudal zygapophyseal lamina instead merges with the postspinal lamina.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=220 TEXT='This unusual elaboration of the coracoid glenoid fossa is well illustrated in Saltasaurus by Powell (1992: fig. 29).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=225 TEXT='Both Upchurch et al. (in press) and Wilson (2002) diagnose this character by noting the "abrupt" or "square" angle of the proximodistal corner of some sauropods.  However, in numerous sauropods coded as lacking this feature actually have a roughly 90° angle at the proximolateral corner of the humerus that technically falls under the heading of "square" and could easily be construed as "abrupt."  The real difference between the taxa coded by both authors as possessing it is that the apomorphic state lacks the prominent, pointed, laterally-projecting process at the proximolateral corner that overhangs the main body of the humerus by a substantial margin.  Thus, in derived sauropods, such as Saltasaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia (Upchurch, 1998: fig. 12), the proximolateral margin, in cranial view, parallels the long axis of the element rather than lying at an angle to it. This process seems to be universally accompanied by the marked convexity of the proximal end of the humerus, and the loss of the proximolateral process is connected to the flattening of the proximal end, but these may need to be separated out as discreet characters in the future.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=258 TEXT='This is the maximum distance between the cranialmost points on the preacetabular alae of the ilia.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=291 TEXT='Wilson and Sereno (1998) discuss correctly the fact that in sauropod outgroups, the tibia is mediolaterally compressed and that in derived sauropods it is "subcircular."  Upchurch et al. (in press) attempted to quantify the vague term "subcircular" by arbitrarily setting the boundary of "subcircular" as when both craniocaudal and mediolateral dimensions are within 15% of each other.  There are two problems with this character that indicate it requires retooling in future analyses.  First, there is little consistency, and too much vagary, in orienting the tibia such that the craniocaudal and mediolateral dimensions can be consistently measured; certainly, it seems that the longest dimension of the proximal tibia is usually (but not always) in the direction in which the cnemial crest points (see character 291), but this is not necessarily either purely craniocaudal or mediolateral.  Some sauropod tibiae display torsion between the proximal and distal ends, making it difficult to pick the true cranial and lateral directions.  Second, highlighting the dangers of using percentages or ratios in phylogenetic characters, the tibia Suuwassea is 19% wider than long, which is technically greater than the 15% specified by Upchurch et al. (in press).  However, it is substantially different than the outgroup, mediolaterally compressed tibia; in fact, it lies toward the OPPOSITE extreme of the potential ratio spectrum.  It has been coded here as possessing the derived state because it seems to be "in the spirit" of the original, intended reading, but future work may require further subdivision of this character into multiple states to accommodate interspecific variation more accurately.  Finally, further work is required on the individual variation of the tibial proximal condyle within a species to better clarify the phylogenetic utility of this character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=293 TEXT='As with character 289, potential exists for slight variations in interpretation of what is truly craniocaudal and mediolateral for an in vivo sauropod tibia.  Slight rotations about the tibial long axis can obscure (to varying degrees) the fibula in "cranial" view, the defining symptom of this character per Wilson and Sereno (1998), but still have the fibula exposed laterally (the "normal" condition).  This is not to say that a valid phylogenetic character cannot be ascertained in the orientation of the cnemial crest, but that future work may need to find a less subjective and less external referent for cnemial crest orientation than one utilizing the entire leg.';
