Spoonlike hairs are present and are short on the upper lip in Cheiromeles, with the length of the hairs in this species apparently autapomorphic. This pattern of distribution results in a distinct hairy islet under the nostrils on the upper lip (Figs. 2 and 3).

Thornlike hairs are absent in Tomopeas, the remaining molossines, and the outgroup taxa. Werner et al.

In contrast, in Neoplatymops, Platymops, Sauromys, and most species of Tadarida, thornlike hairs are distributed over the lips and cheeks (Fig. 2).  Hairs in Platymops, for example, are thickly and densely distributed over the lips and cheeks, while hairs in other species (e.g., species of Tadarida) are more scattered.

Immediately at the narial entrance, the skin in all species is smooth and hairless, and in most molossids, the slightly protruding nares are also hairless.

	TEXT CHARACTER=9 TEXT='A hairy brushlike "mustache,"-- which is mainly located under the nostrils but may extend across the entire upper lip, is present in Chaerephon, Eumops, Mops, Nyctinomops, Otomops, and Tadarida (Fig. 3). The hairs comprising the mustache are neither spoonlike nor thornlike.  Instead, these hairs are long and delicate.  The hairs are positioned perpendicularly to the mouth, and due to the length of the hairs, the lower lip is covered when the mouth is closed.  The function of these hairs is unknown, but they may be sensory. Tomopeas, the remaining molossines, and the outgroup taxa all lack a mustache on the upper lip.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=10 TEXT='Vibrissal papillae are present lateral to the nose in M. (Molossops), M. (Cabreramops), Mormopterus, Neoplatymops, Platymops, and Sauromys. These papillae may be either regularly or irregularly arranged on the face, and a modified spoonlike hair usually rises from their center (Fig. 1). In cases where the papillae are regularly distributed, such as M. (Cabreramops) and Mormopterus  kalinowskii, they resemble the facial wrinkles present in some taxa (see character 11, below). The presence of epidermal irregularities on the face and lips, either vibrissal papillae (Fig. 1) or wrinkles (Fig. 2), appears to be an attribute of most molossid taxa.  ';

These folds are present in Chaerephon, Eumops bonariensis, E. hansae, Mops, Myopterus, Nyctinomops, Otomops, and Tadarida.  Wrinkles along the upper lip are absent in all other molossid species as well as Antrozous and Lasiurus.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=12 TEXT='Facial wrinkles vary in development among those molossids in which they are present.  In Eumops bonariensis, E. hansae, Mops congicus, M. nanulus, M. petersoni, M. thersites, and Myopterus shallow wrinkles are distributed along the upper lip. These wrinkles are often inconspicuous and may give the lip a furrowed rather than deeply wrinkled appearance.  In contrast, in Chaerephon, the remaining species of Mops, Nyctinomops, Otomops, and Tadarida conspicuous, deep, and dorsoventrally elongate wrinkles are present and appear to grow deeper and more pronounced approaching the sagittal plane (Fig. 2).  Outgroup species lack facial wrinkles and we scored these species and all taxa lacking facial wrinkles (state "-''0"-- for character 11) as inapplicable ("-''-"--) for this character.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=13 TEXT='Molossid nostrils frequently are conspicuously separated by papillae (Fig. 3D). Papillae are present in the internarial region in Chaerephon, Molossops, Mops, Mormopterus, Neoplatymops, Nyctinomops, Otomops, and most species of Tadarida (except T. kuboriensis, and T. australis; see below).  Mops presented the greatest inter- and intraspecific variation in the arrangement of papillae; most species presented a short, wide row of small fleshy papillae on the upper internarial region. However, in both M. thersites and M. congicus some specimens we examined have a double row of fleshy papillae, while other individuals lack them entirely.  In Tadarida australis and T. kuborensis (Fig. 2), a fleshy keel is present in the internarial region with papillae at the inferior margin of the keel. We follow Wetterer et al. (2000) in hypothesizing that this keel is homologous to a line of fused internarial papillae, and score this variation below. In contrast, all other species of molossid we examined have a smooth internarial region and lack papillae or a keel between the nostrils. The internarial region is smooth in Antrozous and Lasiurus.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=14 TEXT='Among the molossids with internarial papillae, three distinct morphologies exist. In most species with internarial papillae, the individual papillae are rounded and fleshy. These types of papillae are present in Chaerephon, Molossops, most species of Mops, Mormopterus, Neoplatymops, and Tadarida. In two species of Tadarida, T. kuboriensis, and T. australis, it appears as if these papillae have become fused into a low keel-like structure.  Individual fleshy papillae appear at the inferior margin of the keel and we scored these taxa for the presence of fleshy internarial papillae.  Finally, pointed keratinized papillae are present in the internarial region in Mops congicus, M. nanulus, M. petersoni, M. thersites, Nyctinomops, and Otomops,  Outgroup species lack internarial papillae and we scored these species and all taxa lacking internarial papillae (state "-''0"-- for character 13) as inapplicable ("-''-"--) for this character.';
