        	TEXT CHARACTER=26 TEXT='The postcoxal process is often erroneously referredto as the epimere or proepimeron (e.g. Smetana & Davies, 2000); it is definitely not of pleural origin as those terms imply, but rather a part of the hypomeron (e.g. Hlavac, 1975; Naomi, 1987¨C90: part V).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=27 TEXT='This is the ¡®sternonotal suture¡¯ of Blackwelder (1936), but the ¡®tergopleural suture¡¯ of Naomi';
	TEXT CHARACTER=28 TEXT='The ¡®basisternum¡¯ of Blackwelder (1936) is the¡®composite ventral plat (basisternumtpreepisternum)¡¯ of Naomi (1987¨C90: part V).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=31 TEXT='We apply the term ¡®sternacostal carina¡¯ of Smetana& Davies (2000), originally suggested for the prothorax only.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=32 TEXT='In Tachinus, a narrow intercoxal process of themesosternum conceals the knifelike medial acetabular part of the mesosternum, which is contiguous with the metasternum.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=33 TEXT='A carina of state 1 has apparently been misinterpreted as the posterior carina of the prepectus (Naomi, 1987¨C90: part VI, fig. 4C), but in our examined Paederinae a normally delimited prepectus is also present.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=34 TEXT='The sutures are only vaguely indicated in Nudobius';
	TEXT CHARACTER=36 TEXT='The single carina, or more posterior of thosetaxa with two carinae, apparently corresponds to the ¡®prescutoscutellar suture¡¯ of Blackwelder (1936: fig. 4C), and the more anterior of two carinae to the ¡®prescutal suture¡¯ of the same author and figure, but Naomi (1987¨C 90: part VI) considered the first as a secondary ridge andthe second (anterior) as a prescutoscutal suture. InPseudopsis, the single carina is strongly bicurved and possibly not homologous to the single straight carina of the other taxa.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=40 TEXT='In all examined species of Atanygnathus (includingthe one that we used for this phylogenetic analysis)there is a pair of pale setae (somewhat flattened)attached to the apex of the last tarsal segment ventrally between the claws. These setae (usually protruding downwards) appear to originate on a rudimentary empodium and are interpreted here as empodial. In addition, Atanygnathus has a third long and pale seta at the dorsal part of the apex of the last tarsal segment. The homologyof this conspicuous seta (protruding somewhatupwards) is not clear at the moment. This seta is not considered here as empodial.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=46 TEXT='Venation terminology follows that of Kukalova¡ä -Peck & Lawrence (1993: fig. 46).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=48 TEXT='Note to characters 46¨C50: The presence of one (anterior) transverse basal carina (¡®transverse basal suture¡¯ of Naomi, 1987¨C90: part IX) on each tergum seems to be a widespread and perhaps basal condition for staphylinids; this carina is usually closer to the base of the tergum than to theimbedded spiracles, and is usually continued on the adjacent paratergite. The second (posterior) carina, when there are two, is posterior to the above carina and not continued on the adjacent paratergite.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=53 TEXT='¡®Prototergal glands¡¯ is the term suggested for thesepaired structures on abdominal tergite I in the study by Quennedey et al. (2002). The distinctness and structure of the glands varies among the examined taxa, from vague depressions with different surface sculpture from the rest of the tergite in Dinothenarus to deep cavities with associatedsetae and glands.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=58 TEXT='The presence or absence of odouriferous glandscan be difficult to detect in dead specimens; we base our conclusions in part on published data of others (Fish, 1979; Dettner, 1993; and included references; Herman, 1975). Glands of character state 1 are known to be present in many taxa of the groups Staphylinina and Philonthina (including Dinothenarus and Philonthus), but not in Quedius (Fish, 1979; Dettner, 1993); among other taxa examined in our study, we can also confirmthe presence of such eversible gland reservoirs in Diatrechus and Xanthopygus, but could not detect them (at least as eversible reservoirs) in Atanygnathus, Holisus, Erichsonius, or any of three genera of Amblyopinina examined (Amblyopinus, Edrabius and Myotyphlus), norin Arrowinus or any non-Staphylinini. We also could not detect evidence of such glands or defensive secretions while observing and handling live A. relictus adults (see under Bionomics for that species). Glands of character state 3 are known from at least three genera of Xantholinini(Fish, 1979; Dettner, 1993) and we found evidenceof such a gland reservoir in Nudobius, but not in other non-Xantholinini taxa examined. Fish (1979) specifically sought but did not find apical abdominal glands in species of Tachinus, and Othius of Othiini. We could not locate them in any of our remaining study taxa, but in the absence of live specimens or better-preserved material we cannot exclude the possibility that they are present.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=65 TEXT='The stylus may be minute and, when apparentlyabsent, may be fused to the distal gonocoxite; it is coded as present if there is a distinct membranous articulation between it and the distal gonocoxite. The coding for Maorothius is taken from Assing (2000), who indicates a single pair of gonocoxites (our state 2) for most species, but these are partially or entirely fused in a few species, including M. brouni (the species studied here). Similarly,Herman (1975) describes wide variation for Pseudopsis ¨C not all have fused distal gonocoxites and some (even with fused distal gonocoxites) have styli (states 0, 3 plus styli).';
	TEXT CHARACTER=66 TEXT='According to the most recent views (Smetana,1971, 1988), the aedeagus of Atanygnathus lacksparameres. In agreement with that concept and based on the examination of the species of Atanygnathus used in the analysis, we coded this character state for this genus as ¡®parameres absent¡¯ (3). However, our preliminary examination of the aedeagi of several other species of Atanygnathus, initiated by the comment of one anonymous reviewer of this paper, revealed the possibilitythat the parameres in this genus are not lost butgreatly modified and, in some cases, may look like the median lobe of the aedeagus. This problem needs further study.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=67 TEXT='In the examined species of Erichsonius (E. patella)the peg setae are sharp-tipped and unpigmented, but more typical peg setae (black, round-tipped) are found in other species of the genus (e.g. Coiffait, 1972¨C84: vol. 2).';
